- Verify data encryption and security measures
- Understand where and how client data is processed
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Consider on-premises or private cloud solutions for sensitive matters

### 3. Transparency and Disclosure

Clients have a right to understand how AI is being used in their representation:

- Disclose the use of AI tools in legal work
- Explain how AI assists in case preparation and document review
- Be transparent about the role of AI in legal research and analysis
- Obtain informed consent where appropriate

## Implementation Best Practices

### Due Diligence on AI Vendors

Before selecting an AI solution, conduct thorough due diligence:
