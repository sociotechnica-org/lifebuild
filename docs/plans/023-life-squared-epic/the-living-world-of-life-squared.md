# **The Living World of LifeSquared**

_A Visual and Experiential Guide_

## **Chapter 1: The Living Map of Your Life**

Imagine opening LifeSquared and seeing your entire life laid out before you—not as a overwhelming to-do list, but as a living, breathing empire you're building one thoughtful action at a time.

### **The Empire View: Your Life as Eight Territories**

When you first arrive in LifeSquared, you're greeted by a clean, elegant grid of eight squares. Think of them as city districts in a game like Civilization, but instead of commerce and military, these territories represent the fundamental domains of your personal life.

Each territory is a square with beautifully rounded corners, bearing both a distinctive color and an emblematic seal. The seals are simple, geometric designs—a heartbeat line for Health & Well-Being in emerald green, interlocking hands for Relationships in rose quartz, a coin stack for Finances in deep gold. These aren't just decorative; they're your visual language for navigating life.

Here's what makes this magical: territories you haven't started working on yet appear in a warm, neutral gray—present but dormant, like unexplored lands on an ancient map. They're waiting for you, patient and ready. But the moment you activate work in that area of your life, the territory blooms into its full color. Your Health territory might glow emerald as you start your morning run habit. Your Relationships territory shifts to rose quartz as you schedule that coffee with an old friend.

Within each active territory, you'll notice small, pulsing indicators. These are your active projects—up to three glowing gently like campfires in the night. They're not demanding your attention with harsh alarms; instead, they breathe with a soft, three-second rhythm. One expansion, one contraction. Alive, but calm. When you see that pulse, you know something is in motion, something is being built.

And if you've activated an advisor for that territory—say, your Health Advisor—you'll see their avatar in the upper corner of the territory square. A friendly geometric companion, clearly artificial but somehow trustworthy, with expressive eyes that seem to watch over that domain of your life. Click on them, and you enter their advisory room, where strategic conversations happen.

### **Entering a Territory: The Category View**

Let's say you click into your Health & Well-Being territory. The entire screen gracefully transitions—the empire view scales down and fades, while your chosen territory expands forward, revealing an entirely new landscape.

This is your project ecosystem, and it's organized into several distinct zones, each with its own purpose.

**The Suggestion Box** sits in the upper left corner—a warm coral-colored square with Marvin, your Worker AI agent, ready to help. His geometric form, with those big, expressive eyes, peers out from behind a simple prompt: "CREATE SQUARES." Click this, and it expands like a drawer sliding open, taking up the top quarter of your screen.

Inside, Marvin presents three suggested project tiles, each one ghosted and translucent—these are possibilities, not obligations. They're based on common patterns other users have found valuable in this life area, tailored to what you've already accomplished. Don't like a suggestion? Click the red X in its corner, and it dissolves like morning mist, replaced by another idea. Like one? Click the green checkmark, and it begins to materialize, gaining opacity and definition as you work with Marvin to shape it.

Near Marvin, you'll see gentle prompts: "Want to brainstorm?" or "Want to brain dump your squares?" These aren't pushy—they're invitations, spoken in a helpful tone, waiting for you to be ready.

**The Square Factory** dominates the left side of the view—a production floor where project ideas evolve into real, actionable plans. It's divided into three columns: "To Be Planned," "Planning," and "In Queue."

Projects flow through these stages like an assembly line, but one guided by craft rather than industry. A new project starts in "To Be Planned" as a barely-there ghost—twenty percent opacity, with a dashed outline like a blueprint sketch. As you work with it, adding a status, defining what success looks like, it moves to "Planning" and gains substance. The outline solidifies, the icon inside begins to take shape.

By the time it reaches "In Queue," it's crystallized—eighty percent opacity, a confident presence with a clean border, clear badges showing what type of project it is. It's ready. Ready to become one of your active quests.

**The Active Queue** commands the center stage. This is where your focus lives—a maximum of three project squares, larger than the others, breathing gently with that mesmerizing pulse. They're arranged vertically with generous spacing, each one a small artwork unto itself.

These aren't just tasks; they're quests. You might see labels like "Short-term Quest" for something you'll complete this week, "Medium-term Quest" for a project spanning several weeks, and "Long-term Quest" for your ambitious multi-month initiatives. Each has a progress ring slowly filling around its border, showing you exactly where you stand.

Touch one of these active projects, and you're transported into its detailed view—a full kanban board where all the individual work cards live, where Marvin helps you break down the work, where you can see the documents, the people involved, the entire architecture of getting this thing done.

**The Managed Squares** zone on the right side displays your victories—not completed and forgotten, but successfully automated or delegated. These are the parts of your life that now run themselves.

Each managed square has a grounded, planted quality. You'll see a small shadow beneath it, as if it's rooted in place. In the bottom corner sits the avatar of the AI agent you've assigned to manage it. In the top corner, you might see the next key date—"Oil change: Mar 15"—in small, unobtrusive text. A tiny colored dot in another corner indicates health: green for all systems go, yellow for "needs attention soon," red for "there's an issue."

These squares organize themselves intelligently. The urgent ones, the ones with approaching deadlines or that need your attention, drift toward the center where they're easier to spot. The routine ones, the maintenance tasks humming along just fine, settle toward the edges. Related projects cluster together, creating natural groupings that make sense to your brain.

**The Trophy Case** lives along the bottom—a horizontal gallery of your completed projects. In its collapsed state, it's a subtle scrolling ribbon of small, semi-transparent tokens, each one a ghost of past victories. But click to expand it, and it rises like a hidden drawer, filling forty percent of your screen with a grid of your accomplishments.

Each completed project token holds its story. Click one, and you see the retrospective—how long it took, how it made you feel, what you learned, the performance metrics if they matter. Some might have celebration badges for notable achievements, little marks of honor that acknowledge particularly heroic work.

### **Inside a Project: The Detail View**

When you click into an active or managed project, you enter its dedicated space—what we call the Project Detail View.

The header stretches across the top, anchoring you in place. Your project's icon, now large and commanding, sits to the left. Next to it, the project title in clear, bold typography. The pattern badge—maybe it's the lightning bolt of a Quick Hit, or the circular arrows of a Maintenance Loop—claims its spot in the corner. And there's Marvin again, his avatar in the right corner, ready to help you navigate.

The main area is a classic kanban board: three columns of work cards flowing from "To Do" through "In Progress" to "Done."

But these aren't ordinary task cards. Each one is a perfect square with its own visual story. The top border glows with your category color—emerald for health projects, rose quartz for relationships. The left border tells you what _kind_ of work this is through its style: dotted for Design cards where you're planning and strategizing, solid and thick for Advance cards where you're taking direct action, double-lined for Connect cards involving other people, dashed for Operate cards maintaining what you've built, or gradient for Discover cards exploring the unknown.

The corners of each work card subtly echo the parent project's pattern. Cards from a Quick Hit project have sharper corners—urgent, crisp. Cards from a Maintenance Loop have fully rounded corners—gentle, recurring. Cards from a System Build have beveled edges—architectural, structural.

When a card is in progress, it glows softly. When it's done, it fades to sixty percent opacity with a green checkmark overlaid, celebrating the completion but staying visible so you can review or reopen if needed.

To the right, a side panel shows the humans and AI agents working on this project, the documents you've created, the contacts involved, and the project's meta information—its goals, key dates, its history.

This is where work happens. This is where life gets built, card by card, decision by decision.

## **Interlude: The Philosophy of Feeling**

Before we dive into the precise details of how LifeSquared looks and behaves, let's talk about what it _feels_ like to be there.

**The Core Vision: A Temple for Warrior Monks**

LifeSquared isn't productivity software pretending to be a game, and it's not a meditation app with task lists bolted on. It's something different—a contemplative workspace for purposeful creation. Think of it as a digital sanctuary where building your life feels like crafting something truly meaningful, supported by AI companions who feel helpful rather than intrusive.

The guiding metaphor is this: using well-crafted tools in a beautiful workshop. There's serious purpose here—this is your life, after all. But the materials are satisfying, textured, real. The environment is encouraging without being manipulative. It's a space that's both refuge and forge, where you rest AND build.

This is a futuristic temple for warrior monks. There's the calm, the contemplation, the generous space to breathe. But there's also the work, the building, the purposeful action. The aesthetics balance these forces: the temple's structure and serenity, the craft's materiality and warmth, the game's engagement and delight.

**Where Inspiration Lives**

When we were designing how LifeSquared should look and feel, we drew from some unexpected places. We looked at Duolingo's encouraging gamification—the way it makes progress feel motivating without being manipulative, using bright colors and friendly characters that empower rather than pressure. We studied Headspace's contemplative aesthetics—those soft circular elements, that signature orange that conveys enthusiasm without urgency, those interfaces that maintain engagement while creating genuine calm.

We examined Things 3's tactile precision—how every interaction feels physically satisfying, like touching real paper, gathering real objects. The "Magic Plus Button" that lifts and places tasks exactly where you want them. Those lovely unfolding transitions that keep you oriented as views change. The sense that every element has been purposefully tuned.

From Japanese tea houses and modern monasteries, we learned about creating space that elevates ordinary action into ritual. The way natural materials in their raw state—exposed timber, board-formed concrete, weathered stone—create warmth through material honesty rather than decoration. How the journey from ordinary to extraordinary space happens through gradual transitions.

From the maker movement and artisan craft culture, we understood that imperfection can be a mark of quality. That visible traces of construction—subtle texture, slight variations, the marks of building—tell a story of creation and care. That handcrafted pieces with slight irregularities feel more valuable than perfect factory products because they carry the signature of their making.

**What It's Not**

Sometimes the best way to understand something is through contrast. LifeSquared deliberately avoids certain aesthetics:

Not casino—no black and gold, no flashing lights, no manipulative urgency designed to keep you pulling the lever.

Not factory—no industrial forge imagery, no mass production feel. We're crafting, not manufacturing.

Not retro—no 8-bit nostalgia, no black-and-white film grain. We're modern but warm.

Not cold sci-fi—no neon blues and cyans, no clinical sterility, no dystopian future.

Not cozy anime—no pastels that trivialize, no cute aesthetics that make serious work feel frivolous.

Not austere minimalism—no pure whites that feel sterile. Every neutral has a warm undertone, a soul.
