# Release 9: The Seasons

> **Arc:** The Sanctuary
> **Narrative:** "Time has shape. Winter is lighter. The surplus appears. Jarvis says: your work looks different lately."

---

## GOAL

The complete game. Time gains structure through seasonal rhythm — Spring (planting), Summer (execution), Fall (harvest), Winter (rest). The full capacity economy activates with Maintain/Invest/Spend flows and faucet/sink dynamics. The Shift — the most important emergent behavior in LifeBuild — can now emerge naturally when planted systems generate more capacity than they consume. Jarvis recognizes it conversationally. The sanctuary structure reaches its full visual progression. Every system described in the Context Library is operational.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Seasonal rhythm structures the year: 4 seasons with distinct workload profiles
- [ ] Winter is structurally lighter — reduced expedition scope, emphasis on rest
- [ ] Full capacity economy: M/I/S classification, faucet/sink tracking, capacity surplus detection
- [ ] Annual reflection session with Jarvis: year-over-year comparison, Charter evolution review
- [ ] The Shift detectable: Jarvis recognizes it conversationally ("Your work looks different lately")
- [ ] Sanctuary structure reaches full 3-stage progression (Humble Studio → Growing Workshop → The Sanctuary)
- [ ] Agent coordination fully mature (Conan → Jarvis → Marvin pipeline seamless)
- [ ] Standard - Four Verbs (Tend/Invest/Restore/Venture) explicitly surfaced in builder vocabulary

### Superior Process

| Feature                | Minimum Viable Implementation                                                                                      | Full Vision (deferred)                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Seasonal rhythm        | 4 seasons (~12 weeks each). Jarvis introduces seasonal transitions. Winter = reduced scope, emphasis on Blue-time. | Seasons adapt to builder's actual patterns; seasonal themes customizable |
| Full capacity economy  | M/I/S classification on work. Faucet/sink tracking (steward-side). Capacity surplus/deficit visible to stewards.   | Visual capacity flow diagram; builder-facing capacity insights           |
| Annual reflection      | Jarvis-facilitated yearly review. Conan provides year-over-year data. Charter deep review.                         | Multi-year trend analysis; legacy visualization                          |
| Four Verbs             | Tend/Invest/Restore/Venture vocabulary surfaced in UI and steward conversations                                    | Verb-based filtering; activity classification in analytics               |
| Full adaptation system | System recommends adjustments when patterns diverge from plan. Adaptation = leadership, not failure.               | Automated adaptation suggestions with confidence levels                  |

### AI as Teammates

| Feature                    | Minimum Viable Implementation                                                                                                                                  | Full Vision (deferred)                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Shift recognition      | Jarvis detects pattern (surplus emerging, Gold shifting to aspirational) via prompt-based analysis of Conan's data. Names it conversationally. Never gamified. | Statistical detection with confidence; timing calibrated to individual patterns |
| Deep service levels        | Service Level 4-5 achievable. Team anticipates needs based on seasonal patterns + history.                                                                     | Full anticipatory guidance; proactive strategic suggestions                     |

## BUILDER EXPERIENCE CHECKPOINT

**After this release, the builder can:**

- Experience seasonal rhythm with distinct workload profiles
- Have the full capacity economy running (M/I/S, faucets/sinks)
- Have Jarvis recognize The Shift when it emerges naturally
- Run annual reflections with year-over-year Conan data
- See their sanctuary structure at full visual maturity
- Use Four Verb vocabulary (Tend/Invest/Restore/Venture) intentionally
- Experience the complete LifeBuild game as described in the Context Library

**After this release, the builder CANNOT:**
(This is the capstone release. Anything beyond is expansion, not missing fundamentals.)

- Hybrid physical/digital integration (Spatial L4+ — future technology)
- Fully autonomous agent team (AI L7+ — future capability)
- Multi-builder interaction / shared sanctuaries (not in current vision)

**Bottleneck:** None that's structural. The complete game is operational. Future work is refinement, expansion, and new frontiers — not missing fundamentals. The builder who reaches this point has a living sanctuary with running systems, a team that knows them, structured rhythm, and the possibility of reaching Directed Living.

**Who falls in love here:** Builders who've been on the journey. The Shift is the most sacred emotional moment in the product — Jarvis naming it is the payoff for months of investment. "My life works for me now."

**Viable scale:** Full life, indefinite. The builder has reached or is approaching Directed Living.

## WHAT'S EXPLICITLY DEFERRED

This is the capstone release of the initial vision. Features beyond Release 9 are expansion territory:

| Multi-builder sanctuaries       | New dimension | Shared spaces, collaborative building — not in initial vision     |
| Advanced analytics dashboard    | Refinement    | Conan's narrative analysis may prove sufficient; dashboard if not |
| Voice interaction with stewards | Refinement    | Natural evolution of conversation interface                       |
