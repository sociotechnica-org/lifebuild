# Release 6: The Archives

> **Arc:** The Territory
> **Narrative:** "Conan opens the doors. He tells you things about yourself you didn't know."

---

## GOAL

The team gains institutional memory. Conan — the third steward — activates as the builder's Librarian. The Archives zone opens, making completed projects and uprooted systems browsable and searchable. Conan surfaces patterns the builder didn't see: estimation biases, seasonal tendencies, recurring blockers. Historical context feeds into Jarvis's strategic conversations and Marvin's project shaping. The AI team starts getting smarter over time.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Conan agent active with distinct gruff, direct voice
- [ ] Archives zone accessible with browse and search
- [ ] Completed projects archived with full task history and outcomes
- [ ] Conan surfaces at least 3 pattern types: estimation accuracy, recurring blockers, category trends
- [ ] Historical context injected into Jarvis conversations ("Last time you did something similar...")
- [ ] Marvin references historical performance data when shaping new projects
- [ ] Service level progression visible — the team demonstrably knows the builder better over time

## BUILDER EXPERIENCE CHECKPOINT

**After this release, the builder can:**

- Talk to Conan about their history ("What patterns do you see?")
- Browse completed projects in the Archives with full history
- Have Jarvis reference historical context in strategic conversations
- Have Marvin use historical data to improve project estimation
- See their service level deepen as the team learns more about them
- See Conan coordinate with Jarvis and Marvin (three-steward team)

**After this release, the builder CANNOT:**

- Have capacity-aware expedition planning (no capacity modeling)
- Declare appetite bounds or trigger circuit breakers
- Zoom in/out on the map or drag-rearrange hexes
- Have seasonal structure to their work rhythm
- See personalized generated art on their tiles

**Bottleneck:** Expedition mechanics are still basic — weekly fixed cadence, no appetite declarations, no circuit breakers. Stewards see patterns but can't formally reason about bandwidth. The builder needs the mechanical depth that comes from capacity modeling.

**Who falls in love here:** Reflection-oriented builders. "Conan told me I always underestimate health projects. He was right." People who value being known and understood by their tools.

**Viable scale:** ~25-35 projects, 8-12 systems, meaningful archive of completed work
