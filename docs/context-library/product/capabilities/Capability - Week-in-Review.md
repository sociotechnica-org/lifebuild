# Capability - Week-in-Review

## WHAT: Definition

The structured end-of-week reflection where builders review what happened against what was planned — celebrating completions, understanding what didn't happen, and capturing learnings. Week-in-Review happens in the Council Chamber with Jarvis.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Room(s):
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — where review happens
- Uses:
  - [[Artifact - The Agenda]] — review follows agenda structure
  - [[Artifact - The Charter]] — insights may trigger updates
  - [[Zone - Archives]] — learnings preserved
  - [[Standard - Knowledge Framework]] — patterns captured
- Enables:
  - [[Capability - Weekly Planning]] — bookends the week
- Conforms to:
  - [[Standard - Planning Calibration]] — review measures calibration accuracy, not completion

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — reflection requires partnership
- Principle: [[Principle - Plans Are Hypotheses]] — review tests hypotheses
- Principle: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — learnings compound
- Driver: Builders need to process what happened, not just move to next week. Week-in-Review creates that processing.
- Constraints: Week-in-Review is reflection, not performance review. Jarvis never scores, ranks, or grades the builder's week. Calibration accuracy is data, not judgment.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Future
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** No Week-in-Review capability exists. Depends on Council Chamber and Jarvis, neither of which are implemented. No structured reflection flow, no calibration data capture, no weekly rhythm features.

Core rhythm feature. Week-in-Review closes the weekly loop before planning opens the next.

## HOW: Implementation

**Typical flow:**

1. Jarvis summarizes what was on The Table
2. Review completions — what got done, how it went
3. Review non-completions — what didn't happen, why
4. Pattern observation — what's Jarvis noticing over time
5. Learning capture — anything to remember
6. Charter check — any updates warranted
7. Transition to planning (or schedule for later)

**Jarvis's tone:**

- Never judgmental about non-completion
- Curious about patterns
- Frames adaptation as leadership
- Celebrates genuine progress

**Timing flexibility:**

- Default: Friday afternoon (before or after planning)
- Can be separate session or combined with planning
- Jarvis may prompt if review is skipped repeatedly

**Duration:** Typically 15-30 minutes. Deeper during quarterly reviews.

### Examples

- Jarvis: "You completed your Silver project and adapted your Gold mid-week. What prompted the change?" → builder explains a family situation → Jarvis: "That's happened twice now — Tuesday surprises shifting Gold. Want to note that pattern in your Charter?" → learning captured, no judgment.
- Builder completed nothing from original plan due to emergency → Jarvis: "Intense week. Your calibration data shows this happens about once a quarter — big disruptions that reshape everything. How are you feeling about it?" → framing as data point, not failure.

### Anti-Examples

- **Jarvis presenting a completion scorecard: "3/5 tasks completed, 60% success rate"** — review is learning, not grading. Framing outcomes as a percentage score creates the guilt the system exists to prevent.
- **Skipping the review because nothing was completed** — non-completion weeks often have the richest learning. The review is more important when plans diverged from reality, not less.
