# Capability - Felt Experience

## WHAT: Definition

The builder rates how draining their work feels on a 1-10 scale with color gradients. The system captures this data; stewards reason about patterns. The builder never learns "Red/Gray/Blue" as a framework — they just rate their work. The labels are internal vocabulary.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Zone: Cross-zone — applies to any work the builder completes
- Relates to:
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — felt experience is the builder's input into the capacity model
  - [[Standard - Four Verbs]] — Restore activities should trend Blue; Tend should trend Gray
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — reasons about felt experience patterns over time
  - [[Agent - Conan]] — archives felt experience data for historical pattern recognition
  - [[Dynamic - Rest Deficit Spiral]] — detected through rising drain scores
  - [[Dynamic - The Shift]] — recognized through declining drain scores
- Implements: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — captures data through natural interaction, not forms

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — capacity awareness requires data
- Principle: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — one simple question captures rich capacity data
- Driver: Builders don't know their capacity in abstract numbers. But they know how work feels. The felt experience slider translates subjective experience into data the stewards can reason about — without forcing the builder to learn a framework or fill out a form.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No felt experience capture exists. Tasks have completion status but no subjective rating. The slider, the color gradients, and the pattern analysis are all future features.

## HOW: Behavior

### The Slider

After completing a task or at natural reflection points, the builder is asked: "How draining did that feel?" on a 1-10 scale.

| Range | Zone | Color | Meaning |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ------- |
| 1-3 | Blue | Cool blues | Restorative, energizing |
| 4-6 | Gray | Neutral grays | Neutral, just needed doing |
| 7-10 | Red | Warm reds | Draining, costly |

### What the Builder Sees

A simple 1-10 slider with smooth color gradient. No labels. No framework explanation. Just: "How did that feel?"

### What the Stewards See

Patterns over time:
- Average drain score trending up (capacity declining) or down (sanctuary improving)
- Specific categories or projects that consistently score Red
- Time-of-day or day-of-week patterns
- Seasonal variation

### Steward Usage

Jarvis: "Over the last three seasons, your average drain score has dropped from 6.2 to 4.1. Your sanctuary is getting more comfortable."

Conan: Stores all ratings as historical data. Surfaces patterns on request or during reviews.

### Examples

- Builder completes "Review monthly budget" → slider appears → rates it 5 (Gray, neutral) → data captured → over time, Jarvis notices this consistently scores 4-5 and suggests: "Your finances seem pretty routine now. Could this be systematized?"
- Builder completes "Write chapter 3 of novel" → rates it 2 (Blue, energizing) → pattern: all creative writing scores Blue. Jarvis: "Your creative work consistently energizes you. Worth protecting time for it."

### Anti-Examples

- **Explaining Red/Gray/Blue to the builder** — the framework is internal. The builder just rates 1-10. If you say "You're in the Red zone," you've turned a felt experience into a labeled framework.
- **Making the slider mandatory** — if the builder doesn't want to rate, skip it. Data capture should be frictionless, not forced.
- **Using the data to restrict activities** — "Your drain score is too high to start a Gold venture" is coercive. The data informs steward reasoning; it never gates builder choices.
