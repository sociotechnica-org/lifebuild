# Standard - Reward Philosophy

## WHAT: Definition

LifeBuild uses no extrinsic reward mechanics. The moral principle: building capacity gives you capacity to give. Not the other way around. Systems that say "drain your bucket to earn the right to fill it" are morally injurious. The sanctuary rewards through environmental change, capability growth, capacity returns, insight, and freedom — never through points, streaks, or badges.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Applies to: All product design decisions
- Relates to:
  - [[Aesthetic - Accomplishment]] — what legitimate reward feels like
  - [[Aesthetic - The Shift]] — the biggest reward is emergent, not designed
  - [[Journey - Sanctuary Progression]] — progression IS the reward
  - [[Component - Hex Tile]] — visual evolution as environmental reward
  - [[System - Overgrowth]] — absence is never punished
- Implements: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — intrinsic motivation over extrinsic
- Implements: [[Principle - Protect Transformation]] — Gold ventures shift to aspiration as the natural reward

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — extrinsic rewards undermine the deep process LifeBuild teaches
- Driver: The productivity industry is addicted to extrinsic motivation — streaks, points, badges, leaderboards. These work short-term but crowd out intrinsic motivation long-term. LifeBuild makes the opposite bet: the sanctuary itself IS the reward. A more beautiful map, more capable stewards, more free capacity — these are real, not gamified.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP (principle) through Future (full implementation)
**Implementation status:** Active — anti-patterns actively enforced in design decisions

## HOW: Specification

### Reward Types

| Type          | What It Is                    | Example                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environmental | The map gets more beautiful   | Hex tiles evolve through image evolution stages; sanctuary structure develops         |
| Capability    | Stewards get smarter          | Recommendations improve; the experience personalizes; Conan's archives deepen         |
| Capacity      | Silver investments pay off    | Delegation frees time; surplus appears; The Shift arrives                             |
| Insight       | Archives reveal patterns      | Conan surfaces things the builder hadn't noticed; Jarvis connects dots across domains |
| Freedom       | Gold ventures shift character | The builder does things they couldn't have done before the sanctuary existed          |

### Anti-Patterns (What We Never Do)

| Anti-Pattern              | Why Harmful                             | What We Do Instead                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Points / scores           | External motivation crowds out internal | The map shows progress                         |
| Streaks                   | Punishes absence, creates guilt         | The sanctuary holds                            |
| Daily login bonuses       | Manufactures fake engagement            | Natural engagement through meaningful work     |
| Leaderboards              | Compares lives, which is toxic          | Single-player experience                       |
| "Earn your fun" mechanics | Morally injurious                       | Rest enables work, not the reverse             |
| Failure notifications     | Creates anxiety about the app           | Overgrowth visible on map, not pushed to phone |
| Achievement pop-ups       | Breaks contemplative tone               | Jarvis notes milestones conversationally       |

### Decision Heuristic

When evaluating a proposed feature, ask: "Does this reward come from the sanctuary being genuinely better, or from a number going up?" If the latter, redesign or reject.

### Examples

- Builder completes a project → hex tile evolves visually (Environmental reward). Not: "Congratulations! +50 XP!"
- Builder plants a system → Bronze tasks flow automatically, freeing 30 min/week (Capacity reward). Not: "System Badge Unlocked!"
- Builder visits Conan → discovers they always abandon projects in week 3 (Insight reward). Not: "Archive Achievement: 10 Entries!"

### Anti-Examples

- **Gamification consultants proposing "just a small streak counter"** — there are no small streaks. Any streak mechanic punishes absence. The sanctuary holds.
- **"But engagement metrics will drop without badges"** — if engagement requires extrinsic motivation, the product isn't good enough. Fix the product, don't add sugar.
- **Conversational milestones becoming formulaic** — Jarvis noting "That's the third system this season" is natural. Jarvis saying "Achievement: Triple System Planter!" is not. The line is conversational vs. formulaic.
