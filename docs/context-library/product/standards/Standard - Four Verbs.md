# Standard - Four Verbs

## WHAT: Definition

Every action a builder takes maps to one of four verbs: **Tend**, **Invest**, **Restore**, **Venture**. This is the builder-facing vocabulary for what they're doing in any given moment. The four verbs organize all activity in the sanctuary into a legible framework without requiring the builder to learn internal classification systems.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Applies to: All work across all zones
- Relates to:
  - [[Standard - Three-Stream Portfolio]] — Gold/Silver/Bronze classifies priority; Four Verbs classifies action
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — Maintain/Invest/Spend classifies capacity flow direction (steward-side reasoning)
  - [[Loop - Daily Check-In]] — each micro loop is one of the four verbs
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — expeditions are composed of verb-classified activities
- Implements: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — legible action classification

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — builders need a simple vocabulary for what they're doing
- Driver: Without a verb framework, all work feels the same — undifferentiated tasks on a list. The Four Verbs give builders a way to understand what kind of energy they're spending. Tending feels different from Venturing. Restoring feels different from Investing. Naming the difference creates awareness.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** Tasks exist but have no verb classification. The CODAD task types (Connect, Operate, Design, Advance, Discover) classify task nature, not builder action. The Four Verbs would be a parallel classification at the activity level, not the task level.

## HOW: Specification

### The Verbs

| Verb        | What It Means                                                                                                                 | Typical Stream                  | Felt Experience                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tend**    | Keep the sanctuary running. Execute Bronze tasks, maintain planted systems, handle routine.                                   | Bronze (primary)                | Usually Gray — low emotional payload, needs doing. The game is efficiency.                                                                              |
| **Invest**  | Expand and improve the sanctuary. Build new infrastructure, fix broken things, upgrade existing systems.                      | Silver (primary), some Gold     | Mixed — some draining (cleaning up disasters), some satisfying (new routines), some neutral (optimizing systems). All permanently change the territory. |
| **Restore** | Refill capacity. Sleep, walk, meditate, connect with friends, exercise. Activities that buy your future self time and energy. | Bronze (Blue-time), some Silver | Blue — restorative, energizing. This isn't reward — it's fuel.                                                                                          |
| **Venture** | Go beyond the sanctuary into the frontier. The ambitious project, the creative endeavor, the meaningful commitment.           | Gold (primary)                  | Red to Blue — ventures cost energy but direct capacity toward chosen, meaningful work.                                                                  |

### Relationship to Other Classifications

**Four Verbs vs. Gold/Silver/Bronze:** Different lenses on the same work. G/S/B classifies priority and purpose. Four Verbs classifies the builder's action.

**Four Verbs vs. Maintain/Invest/Spend:** M/I/S is steward-side reasoning about capacity flow. The Four Verbs are the builder-facing equivalent. The builder says "I'm Tending"; the stewards reason about "capacity flowing through Maintain."

### Examples

- Builder tends their meal prep system (Tend, Bronze, Gray) → builder invests time setting up a new exercise routine (Invest, Silver, mixed) → builder takes a walk in the park (Restore, Blue-time Bronze, Blue) → builder works on their novel (Venture, Gold, bright Red/fulfilling)
- A single expedition might include all four verbs: Tend existing systems, Invest in a new one, Restore deliberately, and Venture on the Gold project.

### Anti-Examples

- **Requiring builders to classify every action** — the Four Verbs are a framework for awareness, not a form field. Builders naturally do all four. Stewards may reference the verbs in conversation; the builder doesn't need to label each action.
- **Treating Tend and Restore as less valuable than Venture** — Tending is sacred, not menial. Restoring is fuel, not reward. All four verbs are necessary. A sanctuary with only Venturing and no Tending collapses.
