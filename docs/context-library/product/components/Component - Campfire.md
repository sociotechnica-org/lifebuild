# Component - Campfire

## WHAT: Definition

The origin hex at the center of every new director's Life Map — a warm, inviting starting point that anchors the spatial experience. The Campfire is where directors begin their journey and where Mesa welcomes them during onboarding.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Parent:
  - [[Structure - Hex Grid]] — lives on the hex grid as the origin tile
- Conforms to:
  - [[Standard - Visual Language]] — warm glow, visual aesthetic per spec
  - [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] — Day 1 warm greeting and spatial orientation
- Related:
  - [[Component - Hex Tile]] — sibling component on the hex grid
  - [[System - Clustering]] — first clusters form around Campfire

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] — infinite canvas needs an anchor
- Principle: [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] — new directors need a welcoming entry
- Driver: An empty infinite grid is disorienting. The Campfire provides warmth and orientation — "you are here."

## WHEN: Timeline

Core to onboarding design. The Campfire establishes the spatial metaphor from moment one.

## HOW: Implementation

**Visual treatment:**

- Distinct from regular hex tiles
- Warm glow, inviting aesthetic
- Always visible at center when grid is empty
- Becomes one tile among many as life fills in

**Onboarding role:**

- Mesa appears here to greet new directors
- First projects placed near Campfire
- Natural origin for spatial expansion

**Persistence:**

- Campfire remains even as grid fills
- Directors can return to it (navigation shortcut)
- Serves as "home" anchor in large grids

**Metaphor:** The campfire in the wilderness — a gathering place, a point of warmth, where the journey begins.
