# Component - Silver Position

## WHAT: Definition

The center position on The Table, displaying a single capacity-building project — work that creates future leverage. The Silver position represents infrastructure investment that will reduce future operational burden.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Parent:
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] — center position on the persistent priority overlay
- Conforms to:
  - [[Standard - Three-Stream Portfolio]] — Silver stream slot constraints
  - [[Standard - Visual Language]] — cool silver/platinum color accent
  - [[Standard - Table Slot Behaviors]] — empty Silver visual treatment per spec
- Related:
  - [[Component - Gold Position]] — sibling position on The Table
  - [[Component - Bronze Position]] — sibling position on The Table

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — dedicated slot for leverage work
- Principle: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — Silver builds infrastructure that makes future weeks easier
- Decision: One Silver maximum for same focus reasons as Gold. Capacity-building benefits from sustained attention.

## WHEN: Timeline

Core to Table structure. Silver's role as the bridge between transformation (Gold) and maintenance (Bronze) is foundational.

## HOW: Implementation

**Display contents:**

- Project title
- Project illustration (current evolution stage)
- Progress indicator
- Category color accent on border
- Cool silver/platinum stream accent
- System indicator if project will plant system on completion

**States:**

- **Occupied:** Shows selected Silver project with full treatment
- **Empty (intentional):** Calm visual state indicating strategic choice
- **Empty (unselected):** During planning, prompts selection

**Interactions:**

- Click → Opens [[Room - Project Board]] overlay
- Project completion → If system-building, system plants on Life Map; slot opens
- Mid-week pause → Project returns to Priority Queue top, slot opens

**System-building indicator:** Silver projects marked as creating systems show subtle indicator. On completion, the project archives and a new planted system appears on the hex grid.
