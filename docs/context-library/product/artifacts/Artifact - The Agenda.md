# Artifact - The Agenda

## WHAT: Definition

The session structure that guides conversations in the Council Chamber — a customizable template Jarvis follows to ensure productive strategic discussions. The Agenda provides rhythm without rigidity.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Room: [[Room - Council Chamber]] — where the Agenda is used
- Used in:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Jarvis follows Agenda during sessions
  - [[Capability - Week-in-Review]] — review follows Agenda structure
- Contains:
  - [[Primitive - Session Template]] — structured conversation flows
- Conforms to:
  - [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] — Agenda templates introduced during onboarding
- Related:
  - [[Artifact - The Charter]] — sibling strategic artifact in Council Chamber

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — good conversations have shape
- Principle: [[Principle - Guide When Helpful]] — structure aids, doesn't control
- Driver: Strategic conversations can wander aimlessly. The Agenda provides just enough structure to keep them productive.
- Constraints: The Agenda provides shape, not control. Enough structure to be productive, enough flexibility to be human. Directors can override, modify, or skip any agenda item.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Future
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** No Agenda artifact exists. Depends on Council Chamber and Jarvis, neither of which are implemented. No session templates, no structured conversation flows.

Core to Council Chamber design. Agenda templates refine based on what works.

## HOW: Implementation

**Session types have default agendas:**

**Weekly Check-in:**

1. Review — How did last week go?
2. Patterns — What's Jarvis noticing?
3. Upcoming — What's ahead?
4. Adjustments — Any Charter updates?

**Quarterly Review:**

1. Reflection — Quarter retrospective
2. Themes — What themes are emerging?
3. Charter — Deep review and update
4. Direction — Next quarter framing

**Ad-hoc Strategic:**

1. Topic — What's the decision/change?
2. Context — What matters here?
3. Options — What are the paths?
4. Direction — What's the inclination?

**Customization:** Directors can modify agenda templates. Jarvis adapts to preferences over time.

**Flexibility:** Agenda guides, doesn't mandate. Conversations can deviate when needed.

### Examples

- Weekly check-in begins → Jarvis follows agenda: "How did last week go?" → director reflects → "What patterns am I noticing?" → Jarvis shares a calibration observation → "What's ahead?" → director previews upcoming commitments → "Any Charter updates?" → session ends with structure and substance.
- Director wants to discuss a sudden job offer instead of the standard agenda → tells Jarvis → "Of course — let's focus on that" → agenda flexes → decision conversation happens → Jarvis returns to remaining agenda items if time and energy allow.

### Anti-Examples

- **Jarvis refusing to deviate from the planned agenda** — the agenda guides, not mandates. When a director has something urgent or important, the structure yields. Rigid agendas turn strategic conversation into bureaucratic process.
- **Running every session with no agenda at all** — some structure prevents productive conversations from becoming aimless. Without an agenda, sessions drift toward whatever is most emotionally salient, missing systemic patterns.
