# Artifact - The Charter

## WHAT: Definition

The living strategic document maintained in the Council Chamber — a director's articulated values, current themes, active priorities, and known constraints. The Charter is Jarvis's primary reference and the foundation of strategic conversation.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Room: [[Room - Council Chamber]] — where the Charter is maintained
- Used in:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — strategic conversations reference the Charter
  - [[Capability - Week-in-Review]] — insights may trigger Charter updates
- Contains:
  - [[Primitive - Values]] — articulated through conversation
  - [[Primitive - Themes]] — current life focus areas
  - [[Primitive - Priorities]] — what's important now
  - [[Primitive - Constraints]] — known limitations
  - [[Primitive - Commitments]] — standing obligations
- Conforms to:
  - [[Standard - Knowledge Framework]] — Charter content maps to knowledge domains
  - [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] — initial Charter created during Day 2
- Related:
  - [[Artifact - The Agenda]] — sibling strategic artifact in Council Chamber

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — teammates need shared context
- Principle: [[Principle - Plans Are Hypotheses]] — strategic documents adapt
- Driver: Jarvis needs to know what matters to the director. The Charter captures that — not as rigid doctrine but as living understanding.
- Constraints: The Charter belongs to the director, not the system. Jarvis proposes updates, the director decides. The Charter describes current understanding, never binding commitments.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Future
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** No Charter artifact exists. Depends on Council Chamber and Jarvis, neither of which are implemented. No values/themes/priorities document, no versioning, no agent-shared strategic context.

Core strategic artifact. The Charter develops during onboarding and evolves through ongoing sessions.

## HOW: Implementation

**Contents:**

- **Values:** What matters most (articulated through conversation)
- **Themes:** Current life focus areas (quarterly or seasonal)
- **Priorities:** What's important now (may shift weekly)
- **Constraints:** Known limitations (time, energy, resources)
- **Commitments:** Standing obligations

**Maintenance:**

- Jarvis references Charter in conversations
- Jarvis proposes updates after significant discussions
- Director approves changes
- Historical versions archived

**Not a contract:** The Charter describes current understanding, not binding commitments. Changing it is leadership, not failure.

### Examples

- After a major life discussion, Jarvis proposes: "Based on our conversation, I'd suggest adding 'career transition' as a current theme. Here's how I'd phrase it..." → director reviews, edits the wording, approves → Charter updates → all agents now reference this context in their recommendations.
- Director reviews Charter quarterly → notices "financial stability" theme no longer feels urgent → removes it → Jarvis: "Got it — that priority has shifted. I'll adjust how I frame financial projects going forward."

### Anti-Examples

- **Pre-populating the Charter with default values during onboarding** — the Charter captures the director's own articulation of what matters. Default values would be someone else's words in the director's mouth.
- **Requiring justification for Charter updates** — asking "why are you changing your priorities?" treats evolution as deviation. The Charter changes because the director changes. That's the entire point.
