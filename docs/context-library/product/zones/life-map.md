# Life Map

The primary execution workspace where directors spend most of their time working on projects. The Life Map displays all projects spatially organized across eight life domains, with current priorities always visible at the top via [[the-table]].

---

## What It Contains

### Primary Elements

- [[the-table]] -- persistent priority spotlight showing Gold, Silver, and Bronze work
- Category cards -- eight cards arranged in a grid, each representing a major life domain

### Navigation System

Three altitude levels for viewing:

- **Overview Altitude** -- default view; all category cards visible in grid layout with The Table at top
- **Domain Altitude** -- single category fills most of the screen; adjacent categories dimmed; The Table remains visible
- **Execution Altitude** -- project board overlay with a kanban board; background dimmed but visible for spatial context

---

## User Journey

1. **Enter Life Map** -- see Overview Altitude with The Table and category cards
2. **Scan priorities** -- The Table shows what is most important right now (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
3. **Work on priority** -- click a Table item to open the project board overlay
4. **Complete tasks** -- move tasks through kanban columns (To Do -> In Progress -> Done)
5. **Return to overview** -- close overlay to return to the full map
6. **Explore domains** -- click a category card to zoom into that domain
7. **Navigate freely** -- move between altitudes as needed; The Table stays visible

---

## Boundaries

### This zone is responsible for:

- Displaying all projects across all life domains
- Showing current priorities (The Table)
- Enabling project execution via project board overlays
- Spatial navigation between life domains
- Visual state representation (Live, Plans, Paused, Work at Hand)

### This zone is NOT responsible for:

- Project creation (handled in the planning workspace)
- Priority selection (handled in the planning workspace)
- Worker staffing (handled in the planning workspace)
- Historical analysis (future work)

---

## Adjacent Zones

- Strategy Studio -- planning workspace for creating projects and selecting priorities
- Archives (future) -- historical reflection and pattern analysis

---

## Visual Design

The Life Map embodies the Visual Work strategy:

- **Contemplative aesthetics** -- warm neutrals, generous spacing, calm atmosphere
- **Dignified gamification** -- progress rings and visual states without infantilizing
- **Tactile digital materials** -- cards feel graspable, buttons feel pressable
- **Always-visible priorities** -- The Table never scrolls away

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] How does navigation work on mobile with smaller screen real estate?
- [ ] Should Overview Altitude show project counts or actual project cards on each category card?
