# Zone - Archives

## WHAT: Definition

The learning workspace — where completed projects, uprooted systems, and historical data live. The Archives preserve institutional memory, enable reflection, and surface patterns across all the director's work.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Agent: [[Agent - Conan]] — knowledge manager
- Overlays:
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] — persistent priority display (visible across all zones)
- Adjacent:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — execution workspace
  - [[Zone - Strategy Studio]] — planning workspace
- Primitives:
  - Completed projects with full history
  - Uprooted systems with full history
  - Historical performance data
- Implements: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — institutional memory
- Implements: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — accumulated wisdom
- Feeds: [[Standard - Knowledge Framework]] — historical patterns

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — teammates remember
- Principle: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — history creates value
- Driver: Directors need to learn from experience. The Archives preserve that experience and surface its lessons.
- Constraints: Archives serve learning, not accountability. Historical data is the director's memory, not a performance record. Always accessible, never gated behind agent interaction, never auto-deleted.

## WHEN: Timeline

Core workspace, developing as historical data accumulates. Archives become more valuable over time.

## HOW: Implementation

**Contents:**

- Completed projects (searchable, browsable) with full task history, time data, and final outcomes
- Uprooted systems with uprooting reason and active duration
- Historical Charter versions showing strategic evolution
- Performance data: estimates vs. actuals, calibration trends, stream distribution over time
- Pattern analysis: recurring themes, seasonal tendencies, delegation success rates

**Navigation:**

- Browse by category, stream, time period, or completion status
- Search across all archived content (titles, descriptions, task names, Conan's notes)
- Filter by outcome (completed, cancelled, paused-then-archived)
- Timeline view showing project density and completion cadence

**Conan's role:**

- Maintain archive organization and create summaries for agent consumption
- Identify cross-project patterns ("your Silver projects consistently take 2x estimated time")
- Surface relevant history during planning, when stuck, or during reflection
- Generate periodic retrospective prompts based on accumulated data

**Proactive surfacing:** Conan notices when current work resembles past work and surfaces relevant history — "Last time you did a kitchen project, the contractor phase took longer than expected. Want to adjust your estimate?"

**Search and browse:** Directors can explore their history directly, not just through Conan's surfacing. Archives are always accessible, never gated behind agent interaction.

### Examples

- Director starts a new kitchen project → Conan surfaces: "You completed a kitchen renovation in 2024. The contractor phase took 3 weeks longer than estimated. Want to see the full history?" → director reviews past project → adjusts current timeline based on actual historical data.
- Director browses Archives by category → filters to "Health" → sees completed projects, uprooted systems, calibration trends → notices they consistently underestimate health project scope by 40% → adjusts current health project estimates before planning.

### Anti-Examples

- **Archives accessible only through Conan's proactive surfacing** — directors must be able to browse their own history directly. Agent-mediated access is one path, not the only path. Direct exploration reveals patterns agents might not surface.
- **Permanently deleting archived projects after a time period** — Archives are permanent record. Historical data becomes more valuable over time as patterns emerge across quarters and years. No auto-expiration.
