# Primitive - Task

## WHAT: Definition

A single, completable action that contributes to a project's objectives or fulfills a system's cycle. Tasks are the atomic unit of work in LifeBuild — discrete, actionable, specific, and completable.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Zone: Cross-zone — tasks appear in [[Room - Project Board]], [[Room - System Board]], [[Component - Bronze Position]]
- Implements: [[Standard - Three-Stream Portfolio]] — Bronze tasks flow to stack
- Used by: [[Primitive - Project]] — projects contain tasks on kanban boards
- Used by: [[Primitive - System]] — systems generate tasks according to patterns
- Governs: [[Structure - Kanban Board]] — task flow interface
- Components: [[System - Bronze Stack]]

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — work decomposed into actionable units
- Principle: [[Principle - Visibility Creates Agency]] — tasks make progress visible
- Driver: Directors need atomic work units they can complete in a session (typically 15min-2hrs).

## WHEN: Timeline
- Status: core
- Since: v1.0
- Origin: foundational data model

Core entity. Tasks are the smallest work unit — what directors actually execute.

## HOW: Implementation

### Defining Characteristics

- Discrete (clear beginning and end)
- Actionable (verb-based)
- Specific (concrete enough to execute)
- Completable (typically 15min-2hrs)

**Task sources:**

1. **Inside Projects** — Tasks on kanban boards, moving To Do -> In Progress -> Done
2. **From Systems** — Tasks generated according to system patterns, appearing on Bronze stack

**CODAD task types:**

- **Connect** — Relationship and communication
- **Operate** — Implementation and execution
- **Design** — Planning and conceptual work
- **Advance** — Progress-driving actions
- **Discover** — Research and learning

**Task delegation:** Tasks can be assigned to AI Workers or human delegates via [[Room - Roster Room]].

### Lifecycle States

| State | Definition | Visual Treatment |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| To Do | Task identified but not yet started | Default card in backlog column |
| In Progress | Task actively being worked on | Highlighted card in active column |
| Done | Task completed | Checked-off card, moved to done column |
| Blocked | Task cannot proceed due to dependency | Card with blocked indicator |

### Visual Representation

Task cards on kanban boards within projects, or as stacked items on the Bronze stack. Each card shows the task name (verb-based), CODAD type indicator, delegation status (self, AI Worker, or human delegate), and completion checkbox.

### Examples

1. **"Call dentist to schedule cleaning"** — A Connect-type task inside the project "Schedule annual physical." State: To Do. Appears on the project's kanban board. Estimated at 15 minutes. Not delegated — the director will do it personally.

2. **"Research best budget apps"** — A Discover-type task generated by the system "Monthly finance review." State: In Progress. Appeared on the Bronze stack when the system's weekly cadence triggered. Delegated to an AI Worker for initial research, with the director reviewing results.

### Anti-Examples

- **Not a Task:** "Get healthier" — that is too vague and unbounded to be a task. It belongs as a [[Primitive - Project]] objective or even a life goal, not an atomic work unit.
- **Not a Task:** "Manage my weekly grocery shopping" — that is a [[Primitive - System]], not a Task, because it describes recurring infrastructure rather than a single completable action.
- **Not a Task:** "Renovate the kitchen" — that is a [[Primitive - Project]], not a Task, because it requires decomposition into many sub-actions (get quotes, select contractor, choose materials, etc.).
