# Structure - Kanban Board

## WHAT: Definition

The task flow interface within a Project Board — a visual representation of task states showing what's pending, in progress, and complete. The Kanban Board provides at-a-glance project execution status and enables drag-and-drop task management.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Room: [[Room - Project Board]] — embedded within project detail
- Contains:
  - [[Primitive - Task]] — task cards in columns
- Displays:
  - [[Primitive - Task]] — task cards in columns
- Conforms to:
  - [[Standard - Visual Language]] — task cards, column states render per spec
- Implements:
  - [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] — progress has spatial form
  - [[Principle - Visual Recognition]] — task state instantly visible
- Related: [[System - Bronze Stack]] — Bronze tasks may show here

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] — work flow should be visible
- Principle: [[Principle - Visual Recognition]] — familiar pattern for task management
- Principle: [[Principle - Familiarity Over Function]] — Kanban is widely understood
- Driver: Builders need to see and manage task flow within projects. Kanban provides that at-a-glance view.

**Why the WIP limit of 3:**

- **Research basis:** Sjoberg et al. (2018) studied 8,000+ work items across five teams over four years. Key finding: lower WIP correlates with shorter lead times, aligning with Little's Law (Average lead time = Average WIP / Average throughput).
- **Cognitive basis:** Mark et al. (2005) found approximately 23 minutes to return to full engagement after a task switch. With 3 in-progress items, a builder might switch twice per session. With 6, they never reach deep engagement.
- **Honest caveat:** The kanban research notes "indicating an optimal WIP limit is difficult." Three is a principled starting point, not a proven optimum. Different builders may need different limits, and the system should accommodate that learning.
- **Relationship to The Table:** The Table's 1 Gold + 1 Silver + Bronze stack is a project-level WIP limit. The task-level WIP limit of 3 operates within individual project kanban boards — a two-tier WIP system.
- Constraints: Kanban is for task flow within a single project, not cross-project management. Cross-project priority lives on The Table. WIP limits are recommendations, not enforcement.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** Task kanban exists in `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` with status-based columns. Implementation uses 4 columns (`todo`, `doing`, `in_review`, `done`) rather than the 3 described here (To Do, In Progress, Done) — `in_review` was added for agent workflows. WIP limits are not implemented. Drag-and-drop within kanban is not confirmed. The kanban lives on a full-page project detail route, not within a Project Board overlay.

Core to Project Board design. Kanban familiar pattern chosen for immediate usability.

## HOW: Implementation

**Columns:**

- **To Do** — Tasks not yet started
- **In Progress** — Active tasks (limit: 1-3 recommended)
- **Done** — Completed tasks

**Task cards show:**

- Task title
- Estimated effort (if set)
- Due date (if set)
- Delegated indicator (if assigned)
- Quick actions

**Interactions:**

- Drag between columns
- Click to expand task detail
- Check to mark complete
- Add new task inline

**Constraints:**

- In Progress WIP limit (optional, builder-configurable)
- Done column collapsible
- Order within columns customizable

**Bronze integration:**

- Bronze tasks from this project appear here
- Completing here updates Bronze stack
- Task source indicator (project vs. system-generated)

**Not mandatory:** Simple projects may skip Kanban and use checklist view instead.

### Examples

- Builder opens Gold project "Home Renovation" → Kanban shows: To Do (5 tasks), In Progress (2 tasks), Done (3 tasks) → builder drags "Get contractor quotes" from To Do to In Progress → WIP indicator shows 3/3 → visual signal that focus limit is reached, but not locked.
- Bronze task generated by "Morning Routine" system appears in project Kanban → marked with system-generated indicator → builder completes it → task moves to Done → Bronze stack on The Table updates simultaneously.

### Anti-Examples

- **Enforcing WIP limit as a hard block that prevents dragging additional tasks to In Progress** — the WIP limit recommends, not restricts. A visual indicator signals "you're at capacity," but the builder can override. Soft guidance, not hard control.
- **Requiring Kanban view for all projects regardless of complexity** — simple projects may prefer a checklist view. Kanban is the default for complex task management, but not mandatory. The right tool for the right project.
