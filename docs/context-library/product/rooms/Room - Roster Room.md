# Room - Roster Room

## WHAT: Definition

Devin's dedicated space — where directors assign AI Workers to delegatable tasks, configure human delegation relationships, and optimize team composition for the week's work.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Zone: [[Zone - Strategy Studio]] — planning workspace
- Agent: [[Agent - Devin]] — delegation specialist
- Adjacent:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — strategic conversation
  - [[Room - Category Studios]] — domain-specific planning
  - [[Room - Sorting Room]] — priority selection
  - [[Room - Drafting Room]] — project creation
- Implements: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — team coordination
- Implements: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — delegation patterns improve
- Assigns: Workers — AI agents for task execution
- Configures: Human delegation — family, colleagues, contractors

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — directors have a team
- Principle: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — team effectiveness compounds over time
- Driver: Directors shouldn't do everything alone. The Roster Room is where delegation happens.
- Constraints: Delegation is always director-initiated or director-approved. Devin recommends, the director assigns. No autonomous task handoff. Human delegation tracking is reminder-based, not enforcement-based.

## WHEN: Timeline

Future feature. Worker architecture and delegation framework are in design phase. Roster Room depends on mature Agent coordination (Level 4+ on AI as Teammates ladder) and standing job/permission definitions (Level 3).

## HOW: Implementation

**Worker assignment flow:**

1. Director opens Roster Room from Strategy Studio
2. Devin presents delegatable tasks from the week's Work at Hand and Bronze stack
3. Director reviews available AI Workers and their capability profiles
4. Director assigns Workers to tasks, sets expectations and check-in cadence
5. Devin tracks execution and surfaces results

**Human delegation:**

- Configure recurring delegation relationships (family members, colleagues, contractors)
- Track who does what and follow-up status
- Set accountability expectations and reminder cadence
- Historical delegation patterns inform future recommendations

**Devin's role:**

- Recommend Worker-to-task matches based on capability and past performance
- Surface delegation opportunities directors might miss ("this task looks similar to one you delegated last month")
- Track delegation patterns and improve recommendations over time
- Escalate when delegated work stalls or needs attention

**Output:** Tasks assigned to Workers or humans, with accountability configured and check-in schedule set.

### Examples

- Devin identifies 3 Bronze tasks that match past delegation patterns → presents: "These look like tasks you've delegated before — want to assign them?" → director assigns 2 to AI Workers, keeps 1 → sets Wednesday check-in → Devin tracks execution and surfaces results on schedule.
- Director configures recurring human delegation: "My assistant handles invoicing every Friday" → Devin tracks this relationship → Friday passes without completion flag → Devin surfaces follow-up: "Invoice task from Friday — want to check in?" → accountability without micromanagement.

### Anti-Examples

- **Auto-delegating tasks without director approval** — delegation is a director decision, not an AI optimization. Devin suggests candidates and matches, but the director assigns. Autonomous task delegation violates director agency.
- **Presenting a catalog of all AI Worker capabilities unprompted** — delegation opportunities should be surfaced in context (tasks that match worker skills), not as a capabilities brochure. Show what's relevant, not everything that's possible.
