# Room - Council Chamber

## WHAT: Definition

Jarvis's dedicated space in the Strategy Studio — where directors engage in high-level strategic conversation, conduct weekly reviews, maintain their Charter, and discuss life direction. The Council Chamber is the heart of the human-AI strategic partnership.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Zone: [[Zone - Strategy Studio]] — planning workspace
- Agent: [[Agent - Jarvis]] — primary occupant
- Artifacts:
  - [[Artifact - The Charter]] — living strategic document
  - [[Artifact - The Agenda]] — session structure
- Adjacent:
  - [[Room - Category Studios]] — domain-specific planning
  - [[Room - Sorting Room]] — priority selection
  - [[Room - Drafting Room]] — project creation
  - [[Room - Roster Room]] — delegation management
- Conforms to:
  - [[Standard - Planning Calibration]] — strategic conversations frame plans as hypotheses
- Implements: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — deepest advisor relationship
- Implements: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — Jarvis elicits, never interrogates

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — Jarvis is the primary AI relationship
- Principle: [[Principle - Plans Are Hypotheses]] — strategic conversations hold plans lightly
- Driver: Directors need a thinking partner who knows their whole picture. The Council Chamber hosts that partnership.
- Constraints: Council Chamber is the director's space, not Jarvis's office. The director controls pace, topic, and depth of conversation. Jarvis guides, never drives.

## WHEN: Timeline

Core to Strategy Studio design. Council Chamber is where the Jarvis relationship lives.

## HOW: Implementation

**Session types:**

- Weekly check-in — review past week, frame upcoming week
- Quarterly review — deeper Charter work, theme adjustment
- Ad-hoc strategic — major decisions, life changes

**[[Artifact - The Agenda]]:** Each session follows an agenda (customizable). Jarvis guides through it, captures notes, updates Charter.

**[[Artifact - The Charter]]:** Living document maintained here — director's values, themes, priorities, constraints. Jarvis references it and proposes updates.

**Conversation continuity:** History preserved. Jarvis remembers past discussions, references them, tracks how thinking evolves.

### Examples

- Director enters Council Chamber on a Tuesday → Jarvis: "Last week you mentioned feeling stretched thin across too many Silver projects. Want to revisit that?" → conversation references two weeks of prior context → director adjusts strategy → Jarvis updates Charter note.
- Quarterly review session → Jarvis walks through [[Artifact - The Agenda]] → reviews Charter themes with director → surfaces patterns from past quarter's data → director updates two themes, removes one → conversation captured for future reference → session complete in 25 minutes.

### Anti-Examples

- **Jarvis initiating a conversation without the director entering the Council Chamber** — the director comes to Jarvis, not the other way around. Council Chamber is a place to visit, not a notification to respond to. Push-initiated strategic conversations violate director agency.
- **Jarvis offering prescriptive advice before the director has reflected** — "Here's what I think you should do" before "What are you thinking?" Jarvis guides reflection first, offers perspective second.
