# Three-Stream Model

A conceptual framework organizing work into three fundamentally different streams: **[[gold-slot|Gold]]** (transformation), **[[silver-slot|Silver]]** (leverage), and **[[bronze-stack|Bronze]]** (operations). Each stream serves a different purpose and requires different energy. The model helps directors consciously balance across work types rather than defaulting to whatever feels urgent.

---

## Core Concept

The insight: **work is not homogeneous.**

A director's week contains:

- Work that opens new frontiers and creates transformation
- Work that builds systems and creates future leverage
- Work that keeps life running and maintains operations

Treating all work the same leads to dysfunction:

- **All [[bronze-stack|Bronze]]** → constant firefighting, no progress on what matters
- **All [[gold-slot|Gold]]** → burnout from overreach, life falling apart around you
- **No [[gold-slot|Gold]]** → stagnation, going through motions without growth

The Three-Stream Model makes these categories explicit, manifested visually in [[the-table]].

---

## Why It Exists

**Strategy:** [[visual-work]]
Making work types visually distinct ([[gold-slot]] glow, [[silver-slot]] glow, [[bronze-stack]] stack) reinforces that different work deserves different treatment. Directors see their portfolio balance at a glance.

**Driver:** Observed pattern
Directors without explicit stream thinking consistently over-indexed on operational work ([[bronze-stack|Bronze]]) because it felt productive and urgent. Important-but-not-urgent work ([[gold-slot|Gold]], [[silver-slot|Silver]]) got perpetually deferred.

## How It Works

### The Three Streams

| Stream             | Purpose      | Project Types  | Energy Profile           |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| \*\*[[gold-slot    | Gold]]\*\*   | Transformation | Initiatives (Major/Epic) | High focus, deep work  |
| \*\*[[silver-slot  | Silver]]\*\* | Leverage       | System Builds, Discovery | Medium focus, building |
| \*\*[[bronze-stack | Bronze]]\*\* | Operations     | Quick Tasks (Micro)      | Low focus, execution   |

### Stream Definitions

**[[gold-slot|Gold]] Stream — Frontier Opening**

- Transformative projects unlocking new capabilities or horizons
- One at a time (or intentionally empty)
- Examples: "Launch photography business," "Complete graduate degree"
- Archetype: Initiative | Scale: Major or Epic

**[[silver-slot|Silver]] Stream — Capability Building**

- Infrastructure creating future leverage
- One at a time (or intentionally empty)
- Examples: "Automate bill payments," "Build project template system"
- Archetypes: System Build, Discovery Mission | Scale: Moderate to Major

**[[bronze-stack|Bronze]] Stream — Operational Execution**

- Small tasks keeping life running
- Multiple (minimum 3, scales with capacity)
- Examples: "Schedule dentist," "Pay bills," "Replace air filters"
- Archetype: Quick Task | Scale: Micro

### Classification Logic

Projects are assigned to streams based on:

1. **Archetype** — Initiative → [[gold-slot|Gold]]; System Build/Discovery → [[silver-slot|Silver]]; Quick Task → [[bronze-stack|Bronze]]
2. **Scale** — Major/Epic → [[gold-slot|Gold]] eligible; Moderate → [[silver-slot|Silver]] eligible; Micro → [[bronze-stack|Bronze]]
3. **Manual override** — Director can tag projects if automatic classification doesn't match intent

---

## Where It Appears

- [[the-table]] — three positions ([[gold-slot]], [[silver-slot]], [[bronze-stack]]) implement this model
- [[priority-queue]] — filters (Gold Candidates, Silver Candidates, Bronze Candidates) organize by stream
- [[sorting-room]] — selection process walks through each stream separately

---

## Related Systems

**Prerequisites:**

- [[project]] — projects need archetype and scale for classification

**Complements:**

- [[work-at-hand]] — status applied when items occupy Table positions
- [[priority-queue]] — organizes candidates by stream

**Enables:**

- [[the-table]] — physical structure built around three streams

## Constraints & Rules

| Constraint                    | Rule                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[gold-slot]]/[[silver-slot]] | Singular—max one project per stream on [[the-table]]         |
| [[bronze-stack]]              | Plural—multiple tasks, minimum 3 to activate                 |
| Empty                         | [[gold-slot]] and [[silver-slot]] can be strategically empty |
| Overlap                       | Project belongs to one stream only                           |

## Strategic Implications

### Balancing Streams

Healthy weeks often include all three streams:

- **[[gold-slot|Gold]]** — progress on what matters most
- **[[silver-slot|Silver]]** — building infrastructure for easier future weeks
- **[[bronze-stack|Bronze]]** — keeping life running smoothly

Balance varies by life season:

- **Recovery** — heavy [[bronze-stack|Bronze]], light/empty [[gold-slot|Gold]] and [[silver-slot|Silver]]
- **Building** — heavy [[silver-slot|Silver]], moderate [[bronze-stack|Bronze]], light [[gold-slot|Gold]]
- **Pushing** — heavy [[gold-slot|Gold]], moderate [[bronze-stack|Bronze]], light [[silver-slot|Silver]]

### Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern     | Symptom                            | Fix                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Bronze trap      | Only operational work, no progress | Commit to [[gold-slot    | Gold]]/[[silver-slot   | Silver]] weekly |
| Gold burnout     | Always pushing, life falling apart | Leave [[gold-slot        | Gold]] empty sometimes |
| Silver avoidance | Fighting fires forever             | Invest in infrastructure |

## Evolution

**Supersedes:** null (original design)

**Future:**

- Visual feedback when streams imbalanced over time
- Suggested stream allocation based on past patterns

## Open Questions

- [ ] How do Critical Response projects fit? (Currently classified by scale)
- [ ] Should stream history be visible? ("You've had empty [[gold-slot|Gold]] for 3 weeks")
