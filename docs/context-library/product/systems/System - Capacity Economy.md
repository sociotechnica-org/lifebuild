# System - Capacity Economy

## WHAT: Definition

The single currency in LifeBuild is capacity — a composite of time, energy, cognitive bandwidth, and emotional reserves. Capacity is not a number the builder sees on screen. It's a felt reality that the system models and the stewards reason about. Capacity flows through the builder's life in three directions: Maintain (flow-through), Invest (flow-in), and Spend (flow-out).

## WHERE: Scope

- Applies to: All work across all zones
- Relates to:
  - [[Standard - Four Verbs]] — builder-facing action vocabulary (Tend/Invest/Restore/Venture maps to M/I/S)
  - [[Standard - Three-Stream Portfolio]] — G/S/B and M/I/S are two lenses on the same work
  - [[Capability - Felt Experience]] — builder's subjective capacity input (Red/Gray/Blue)
  - [[Dynamic - Bronze Flood]] — maintenance drain exceeding capacity
  - [[Dynamic - Rest Deficit Spiral]] — personal investment (Restore) absent
  - [[Dynamic - The Shift]] — compounding inflection when faucets exceed sinks
  - [[Dynamic - Over-Expansion]] — sinks exceed faucets from territorial ambition
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — reasons about capacity patterns, surfaces honest picture
  - [[Agent - Marvin]] — models capacity in expedition shaping
- Implements: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — structured capacity management

## WHY: Rationale

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — capacity is the constraint that makes process necessary
- Principle: [[Principle - Empty Slots Strategic]] — capacity-first philosophy
- Driver: Builders are overwhelmed not because they lack knowledge but because they lack bandwidth. The Capacity Economy models this constraint honestly and creates the dynamics (compounding, The Shift) that resolve it over time.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No capacity modeling exists. No M/I/S classification. No faucet/sink tracking. The felt experience slider (Red/Gray/Blue) is not implemented. Stewards cannot reason about capacity because no data flows into the system. The entire economy depends on future implementation of the felt experience capture and system-level tracking.

## HOW: Mechanics

### The Flow Model

**Maintain (flow-through):** Capacity passes through to keep the sanctuary operational. The goal is minimizing friction. Well-systematized maintenance costs less over time. Neglected maintenance costs more.

**Invest (flow-in):** Capacity is generated or restored.

- _Systemic investment:_ Creating systems that generate recurring infrastructure, building future temporal capacity. Each planted system is a permanent faucet. Silver projects build the skills and foundations; systems formalize the recurring work.
- _Personal investment:_ Restorative activities that rebuild the builder's internal capacity. Sleep, exercise, meditation, chosen leisure.

**Spend (flow-out):** Capacity is directed toward outcomes.

- _Obligatory spend:_ Draining work that needs doing. Dark red. Capacity out, relief back.
- _Chosen spend:_ Meaningful work the builder selected. Bright red. Capacity out, fulfillment back.

### Faucets (Capacity Sources)

| Faucet                          | Type       | Mechanism                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blue time activities            | Personal   | Restoration of emotional, physical, mental capacity      |
| Planted systems                 | Systemic   | Recurring infrastructure reduces future manual effort permanently |
| Delegation to attendants/humans | Systemic   | Work handled by others frees builder capacity            |
| System optimization             | Systemic   | Existing system made more efficient, reducing upkeep     |
| Completed draining Gold         | Mixed      | Removing a psychological burden frees cognitive capacity |
| Seasonal rest (Winter)          | Structural | Reduced activity load built into the game's rhythm       |

### Sinks (Capacity Drains)

| Sink                               | Type           | Mechanism                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bronze maintenance (system upkeep) | Ongoing        | Every planted system generates recurring tending tasks    |
| Active Gold ventures               | Per-cycle      | Current expeditions consume capacity during execution     |
| Active Silver builds               | Per-cycle      | Infrastructure construction costs before it pays off      |
| Overgrowth recovery                | Penalty        | Neglected systems cost MORE to restore than to maintain   |
| External life events               | Uncontrollable | Capacity redirected outside the game                      |
| Over-expansion                     | Self-inflicted | Too many planted systems = unsustainable maintenance load |

### Inflation Controls

| Control                   | Mechanism                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WIP limits on The Table   | Max 1 Gold, 1 Silver active. Hard cap prevents overcommitment.             |
| Appetite declarations     | Builders cap expedition scope BEFORE planning. Fixed time, variable scope. |
| Steward capacity modeling | Jarvis surfaces honest capacity picture with curiosity, not authority.     |
| Circuit breakers          | Expeditions that exceed appetite don't auto-extend. Forces reshaping.      |
| Seasonal rhythm           | Winter is structurally lighter.                                            |
| Overgrowth visibility     | Map shows overextension before it becomes crisis.                          |

### The Compounding Curve

Early investments feel expensive relative to return. First planted system saves 30 minutes/week but took 3 hours to build. Each subsequent system compounds. By 8-10 planted systems: Bronze is systematized, tending is delegated, hours per week freed permanently, capacity surplus exists. This inflection IS [[Dynamic - The Shift]].

### G/S/B × M/I/S Mapping

|        | Maintain | Invest                 | Spend   |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| Gold   | Rare     | Rare                   | Primary |
| Silver | Never    | Primary                | Never   |
| Bronze | Primary  | Occasional (Blue-time) | Rare    |

This mapping is steward-side reasoning, not builder-facing vocabulary.

### Examples

- Builder has 3 planted systems: ~3 hrs/week Maintain. Invests 2 hrs in a new Silver project (Invest). Takes a 1-hour walk (Invest/personal). Spends 4 hours on Gold novel writing (Spend/chosen). Total: ~10 hrs/week directed capacity.
- After 10 planted systems: ~5 hrs/week Maintain (efficient from practice + delegation). 3 hrs freed permanently vs. doing it all manually. Net capacity surplus redirected to Ventures.

### Anti-Examples

- **Showing capacity as a number on screen** — capacity is a felt reality, not a dashboard metric. Stewards reason about it; builders feel it.
- **Gamifying capacity (energy points, stamina bars)** — LifeBuild is not an idle game. Capacity is modeled for steward intelligence, not displayed as a game mechanic.
