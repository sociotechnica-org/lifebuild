# System - Service Level Progression

## WHAT: Definition

The invisible mechanism governing how AI capabilities evolve based on director engagement over time. Directors don't interact with Service Level Progression directly — they simply use LifeBuild, and the system tracks depth of relationship to unlock progressively better agent performance. Levels reflect genuine system capability growth, not gamification.

## WHERE: Scope

- Zones:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — level affects quality of agent interactions across the map
- Rooms:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Jarvis discusses progression and capability growth
- Capabilities:
  - [[Capability - Week-in-Review]] — review data feeds level calculation
- Primitives:
  - [[Primitive - Director]] — level is a property of the director's account
- Implements:
  - [[Standard - Service Levels]] — defines level thresholds and capabilities
  - [[Standard - Visual Language]] — level indicators and progress display render per spec
- State:
  - Current level (0-5): Newcomer, Establishing, Building, Developing, Maturing, Flourishing
  - Progress toward next level threshold
  - Capabilities unlocked at current level
- Transitions:
  - Level advancement triggers based on engagement depth (weeks of consistent use, pattern emergence, historical data accumulation)
  - Never regresses — levels reflect cumulative relationship, not recent activity
- Processing:
  - [[Agent - Conan]] — historical data feeds level calculation
  - Agent quality scales with level — higher levels yield better recommendations, deeper pattern recognition
- Rationale:
  - [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — visible compounding of system intelligence
  - [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — agents improve with levels

## WHY: Rationale

- System: [[Standard - Service Levels]] — levels need visibility to motivate
- Principle: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — seeing progress reinforces investment
- Driver: Directors should see their relationship with LifeBuild deepening. Progression makes the invisible visible.
- Constraints: Progression reflects system capability growth, not director achievement scores. No badges, no leaderboards, no feature locks. Levels are honest about what the system can and cannot yet do.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Future
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** No Service Level system exists. No tiered progression, no engagement-based advancement, no differentiated agent behavior by level.

Core system. Progression develops as Service Level mechanics mature.

## HOW: Implementation

**Level summaries:**

| Level | Name         | Threshold                |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| 0     | Newcomer     | New account              |
| 1     | Establishing | First week complete      |
| 2     | Building     | Consistent weekly rhythm |
| 3     | Developing   | Patterns emerging        |
| 4     | Maturing     | Strong historical data   |
| 5     | Flourishing  | Deep partnership         |

**Agent quality indicators:**

- Higher levels = better agent recommendations
- Jarvis notes: "With more history, I can see patterns..."
- Visible connection between engagement and service quality

**Not gamification:** Levels reflect genuine capability growth, not arbitrary points. No badges, no leaderboards — just honest representation of system capability.

### Examples

- New director at Level 0 (Newcomer) -> completes first week of planning and review -> advances to Level 1 (Establishing) -> Jarvis notes: "With a week of history, I can start noticing basic patterns in your preferences" -> capability connection made visible.
- Director at Level 3 (Developing) for three months -> Jarvis: "I've seen 12 weeks of your planning now. Your calibration is improving — estimates are 20% closer to reality than month one" -> the relationship depth is tangible.

### Anti-Examples

- **Awarding badges for arbitrary engagement metrics** — "You viewed your Life Map 10 times!" is gamification. Progression reflects genuine system capability growth (better predictions, deeper pattern recognition), not click counts.
- **Gatekeeping features behind level requirements** — levels describe what the system can do for the director, not what the director is allowed to do. All features are available from Day 1. Higher levels unlock better quality, not access.
