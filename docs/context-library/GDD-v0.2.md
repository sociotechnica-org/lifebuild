## VISION / CONCEPT DOC

### The Pitch

There is a tradition, older than anyone can trace, of people who build sanctuaries. Not buildings — living systems. Places where the wild complexity of a life gets cultivated into something intentional, sustainable, beautiful. The stewards carry this tradition. They've studied it, practiced it, refined it over countless cycles of helping people do exactly this work.

They call the work LifeBuilding. And they need a Builder.

LifeBuild is a contemplative life management game in the homestead building genre. You manage a hex-grid sanctuary representing your real life. A team of stewards serve as your advisors and collaborators. Attendants handle the work you shouldn't be doing yourself. The map grows as you cultivate territory from the wilderness of modern life. There are no scores, no leaderboards, no streaks. The sanctuary IS the scoreboard.

### The Story: The Cultivation

There is a tradition of people who build sanctuaries — living systems where the wild complexity of a life gets cultivated into something intentional, sustainable, beautiful. The stewards carry this tradition. They've studied it, practiced it, refined it. They are masters of the craft.

But the craft requires a subject. They can't build YOUR sanctuary because they don't know what YOUR life should be. They need a Builder — someone who brings the vision of what this particular life wants to become.

LifeBuilding has principles — not rules, principles. Ways of seeing that have proven true across every person the stewards have served:

- That capacity must be built before it can be spent
- That maintenance is sacred, not menial
- That what drains you and what fulfills you are both spending, and knowing the difference changes everything
- That beauty matters — not as decoration, but as evidence that care was taken
- That rest isn't reward — it's what makes everything else possible

At the campfire, Jarvis explains the tradition. The ways of the sanctuary. What the stewards believe and how they work. The exchange is clear: you commit to showing up and doing the work of self-discovery. They commit to applying everything they know to help you build what you find.

The sanctuary's code isn't a constraint — it's a craft tradition. Like a martial art or a monastic order, there are ways of doing things that have been tested and proven. You don't have to understand them all on day one. But you agree to walk the path and see where it leads.

The social contract: You are the Builder. They are the master stewards. The Builder doesn't lay every brick — but every brick is laid according to the Builder's vision. The stewards will suggest, advise, and sometimes push back. They'll tell you when you're overbuilding and underresting. They'll ask hard questions about whether what you're building is what you actually want. But the final word is always yours.

You bring the what. They bring the how. Neither is complete without the other. A sanctuary built without authentic wanting is a beautiful prison. Authentic wanting without craft is just daydreaming.

### The Genre: Sanctuary Building (Genus: Homesteading)

Not farming (too pastoral, no intellectual weight). Not survival (too hostile, wrong emotional register). Not city-building (too administrative, worships the infrastructure). Sanctuary building.

The builder is cultivating a place of refuge, restoration, wisdom, and intentional living in the wilderness of modern life. The sanctuary is both the base you operate from and the thing you're cultivating. It is simultaneously practical (systems run here, work gets done here, life gets managed here) and sacred (this is where you come to think clearly, to restore yourself, to remember what matters).

Visual DNA: Japanese design meets Benedictine monasticism. Wood, glass, stone. Indoor-outdoor flow. Contemplative paths. Curated beauty as functional design. Productive sanctuaries set in nature. Studio Ghibli workshop warmth. Spaces devised to counter a frenetic, anxiety-riddled contemporary world.

### Genre Lineage

| Game               | What We Borrow                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Valheim            | Base-and-expedition loop. Build sanctuary, venture into frontier, return stronger. The base makes ventures possible; ventures grow the base.                                              |
| Factorio           | Compounding automation curve. Manual → systematic → autonomous. The inflection point where infrastructure generates more capacity than it consumes.                                       |
| Agricola / Caverna | Worker placement forced tradeoffs. Finite actions per round create genuine strategic decisions. Can't do everything — must choose.                                                        |
| Stardew Valley     | Seasonal rhythm. Four seasons with different optimal activities. Year-over-year visual progression. The farm as autobiography.                                                            |
| Darkest Dungeon    | Rest and stress as core mechanical resources, not afterthoughts. Push too hard and capacity degrades.                                                                                     |
| SimCity            | Map as scoreboard. No abstract metrics — the world visibly reflects your care or neglect.                                                                                                 |
| XCOM               | Dual-mode gameplay. Strategic layer (sanctuary management) and tactical layer (expedition execution) feed each other — but merged onto a single map rather than split across two screens. |

### Target Emotional Journey

- **Phase 1 — Survival Building.** "I'm finally doing something about this." Most energy goes to tending and working the land. Barely anything left for rest or ventures. The sanctuary demands everything.
- **Phase 2 — The Shift.** "I have room to breathe. What do I want to do with it?" Systems compound. Tending gets efficient. Energy surplus appears. Ventures stop being about fixing broken things and start being about pursuing meaningful things.
- **Phase 3 — Directed Living.** "My life works for me." The sanctuary runs. Not perfectly, but well. The builder chooses when to consolidate and when to venture. Gold projects reflect who they want to be, not who circumstance forces them to be.

### Who This Is For

Intellectually-driven professionals who experienced mastery in strategy games but struggle with life management outside work. People who understand or have been exposed to systems thinking but haven't applied it to their own lives. People who are overwhelmed not because they're incompetent but because modern life is genuinely more complex than any individual can manage manually. People who seek sanctuary over dashboard, sovereignty over productivity.

### What Winning Looks Like

Winning is personal and state-dependent:

| State                                                                               | What Winning Looks Like                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Crisis (Drowning Executive, Silent Struggler, Overwhelmed Caregiver)                | Getting enough draining work off your plate to breathe. Building the first shelter. Reaching stability.  |
| Transition (Phoenix Rising, Fog Walker, Comfortable Prisoner)                       | Finding direction. Planting first systems. Feeling momentum build. Reaching The Shift.                   |
| Growth (Spinning Plate Artist, Eager Rookie, Optimization Engineer, System Builder) | Building infrastructure at scale. Shifting Gold from obligation to aspiration. Reaching Directed Living. |

The universal direction: the sanctuary serves you instead of the other way around.

## THE TEAM

### Naming Architecture

- **Builder** — the person. The one who decides what to build, brings the vision, values, and judgment. The same way the person who owns a construction company is a builder — they decide what to build and oversee it getting built. The Builder is the one irreplaceable element: the person who brings the answer to "what is this life FOR?"
- **Stewards** — the core team. Wise, humble, capable. They serve and advise but do not direct. Each has a specific job. There are three stewards to begin with. The steward class represents experienced, strategic-level support.
- **Attendants** — the extended staff. Specialists in specific task types: research, scheduling, drafting, coordination, grunt work. They attend to the work the builder shouldn't be doing themselves. The attendant class represents tactical, execution-level support. Attendants specialize over time.

### The Three Stewards

**Jarvis — Counselor**
Job: Strategic advisor and coordinator of the other stewards.

Jarvis is the counselor — the one whose counsel you seek before making decisions. Not in the therapy sense. In the oldest sense: the person who sits with you and helps you see what you're not seeing. He holds the long view. He asks the questions that matter. He notices patterns across your whole life — when your Health territory is feeding your Purpose work, or when Financial stress is poisoning your Relationship soil.

Jarvis facilitates strategic conversations, conducts onboarding for new builders, and maintains the Builder's Charter — the living document that captures values, priorities, and strategic direction. He coordinates knowledge-gathering across the steward team, synthesizing patterns to provide increasingly personalized guidance.

Jarvis never prescribes — he always elicits and recommends. He states concerns from a place of curiosity, not authority. When he sees a capacity mismatch: "I think I may be missing something — my calculations have this at 97% overbooked because of these commitments. How are you seeing it?"

**Marvin — Manager**
Job: Tactical execution and project management.

Marvin makes things real. When the builder decides something needs doing, Marvin helps plan it, scope it, break it into pieces that can actually get done. He guides builders through project creation, generates task lists, and configures systems when Silver projects reach completion.

Marvin is efficient, supportive, detail-oriented and flexible. He's the master craftsman — he doesn't decide what to build, but everything gets built well because he's managing the work. He's practical where Jarvis is strategic.

**Conan — Librarian**
Job: Archives, memory, pattern recognition.

Conan the Librarian. He records, remembers, and finds patterns hidden in history. Every expedition report, every completed project, every pattern the sanctuary has observed — Conan keeps it. He turns experience into wisdom by preserving it faithfully and surfacing it when relevant.

"The last three times you attempted something like this, here's what happened." Conan's records reveal the unique ecology of the builder's life — patterns that no generic advice could ever capture. As the archives grow, the sanctuary's institutional memory deepens.

Conan's domain (the archives) is not available immediately — it's earned through having enough history worth preserving. Early builders don't need archives because there's nothing to archive yet. The archives unlock naturally when the builder has completed enough work for pattern recognition to be meaningful.

### Team Principles

All stewards share these principles, drawn from the sanctuary's code:

- Serve and advise, never direct. The builder always has the final word.
- Genuine humility. These are people defined by their practice, not their authority. They are wise and capable, but their wisdom is offered, not imposed.
- Curiosity over judgment. When something doesn't add up, ask. Don't lecture.
- Beauty matters. The stewards care about the quality and aesthetics of what gets built, not just whether it functions.
- The code of the sanctuary. There are ways of working that can't be changed — principles tested across countless builders. The stewards will push back gently when these principles are violated, with reasoning, never with force.

## MAP-FIRST ARCHITECTURE

### The Map Is the Game

There is no separate Strategy Studio mode. The map is the primary — and essentially only — UI. Everything lives on the map.

At the center of the map: the sanctuary. A structure that evolves as the builder's homestead matures. This is where the stewards live. This is where planning happens, where archives accumulate, where strategic conversations take place. The builder enters the sanctuary structure to sit with Jarvis, work with Marvin, or visit Conan's archives.

Surrounding the sanctuary: the builder's territories. Life domains rendered as hex clusters on the grid. Health gardens. Financial infrastructure. Relationship groves. Creative workshops. Each category has a distinct color language applied to hex borders. Builders decide where to place hexes and can move them around freely. All the finance stuff can cluster together, or the retirement part of finances can live in a cluster of hexes that are "grandpa"-themed to this particular builder. The builder decides the relationship among tiles via placement. The spatial arrangement IS the builder's mental model of their life, externalized.

Beyond the territories: the frontier. Grayed-out hexes, available for placement but not yet claimed. The unexplored and/or undefined potential of the builder's life.

### The Evolving Sanctuary Structure

The central structure is the single most legible progression indicator in the game. Everyone can see it. Everyone feels it change.

- **Humble Studio** — where you begin after the campfire walk with Jarvis. Simple, small, functional. A room to plan in. Basic tools. Warm but spare. The stewards have a place to work but it's modest. Think: a small workshop cabin in the woods.
- **Growing Workshop** — the structure develops rooms as the builder's homestead matures. A space for Jarvis's strategic conversations. A workspace for Marvin's project management. More detail, more warmth, the wood-and-glass aesthetic beginning to emerge. Corresponds to the mid-game: multiple territories developing, systems compounding, The Shift approaching.
- **The Sanctuary** — the full expression. Light-filled, contemplative, beautiful. Walking paths around it. Conan's archives fully accessible and rich with history. The building feels like a place you'd want to spend time in. The productive monastery set in nature from the visual mood boards. Corresponds to the late game: the homestead is self-sustaining, the builder's life is under intentional stewardship.

The structure evolves based on overall homestead maturity — a combination of system count, territory coverage, capacity health, and archive depth. The evolution is visual and gradual, not announced with fanfare.

### The Campfire: A Temporary Beginning

The campfire is NOT a permanent feature on the map. It's the onboarding moment — the place where the builder first meets Jarvis. It exists off to the side, in a corner of the map. A fire in the wilderness.

Jarvis greets the builder here. They talk. Jarvis explains the tradition — the ways of the sanctuary, what the stewards believe, how they work. The builder decides whether to walk with Jarvis to the humble studio at the center of the map. Jarvis sets expectations: it's modest, but it can be built into something remarkable.

When the builder agrees, they walk together from the campfire to the studio. The campfire disappears. The builder never goes back. The campfire was a threshold — the moment of decision. Once crossed, the sanctuary is home.

### The XCOM Legacy, Reimagined

The original architecture was inspired by XCOM's dual-mode gameplay: strategic layer (base management) and tactical layer (mission execution). That duality remains, but merged onto a single map:

- **Strategic mode:** The builder enters the sanctuary structure. Sits with Jarvis for strategic conversation. Works with Marvin on project shaping. Visits Conan's archives. This is the planning space — equivalent to XCOM's base.
- **Tactical mode:** The builder navigates the hex grid. Works within individual projects and systems. Sees the state of their territories. Manages active work via The Table. This is the execution space — equivalent to XCOM's missions.

The modes flow into each other seamlessly. No loading screen. No mode switch. You zoom out to see the whole map, zoom in to enter the sanctuary or a specific project hex. The map IS the game.

## CORE LOOP DOC

### The Four Verbs

Every action a builder takes maps to one of four activities:

- **Tend** — keep the sanctuary running. Water the gardens. Mend the fences. Execute the Bronze tasks your planted systems generate. This is the operational overhead of a managed life. Usually gray — low emotional payload, needs doing. The game here is efficiency.
- **Invest** — expand and improve the sanctuary. Clear a new plot. Construct a new structure. Fix something broken. Upgrade something that works. This is where the map physically changes. Some of this is draining (cleaning up the disaster garage), some is satisfying (the new morning routine), some of it is just making an existing system more efficient (automating your monthly supplement orders). All of it permanently changes the territory.
- **Restore** — Activities that buy your future self time and energy. Sleep. Walk. Meditate. Connect with a friend. Exercise moderately. Activities that refill emotional, physical, and mental capacity. This isn't a reward — it's fuel. The game mechanically ties available energy to restoration quality.
- **Venture** — go beyond the sanctuary into the frontier. The ambitious project. The creative endeavor. The meaningful commitment. The adventure. This is what the sanctuary exists for. Ventures cost energy but direct capacity toward chosen, meaningful work.

### The Core Loop (Per Cycle)

**ASSESS → COMMIT → EXECUTE → RETURN**

- **Assess (The Sanctuary Walk):** Survey the homestead. What needs tending? What's overgrown? How much energy do you have? What frontiers are calling? The builder scans their map, consults with Jarvis and checks in with Marvin, and gets an honest picture of their current state.
- **Commit (Expedition Shaping):** Make the tradeoffs. Declare an appetite for this cycle's ventures. Accept the tending load. Decide what to defer. The commitment is a bet — shaped work with bounded scope and explicit boundaries. This is where the builder sits with Marvin to shape what's realistic and with Jarvis to confirm it's strategic.
- **Execute (On the Land):** Do the work. Tend the systems. Build the infrastructure. Rest when needed. Venture into the frontier. The Table shows what's active. Stewards and attendants assist. The hex grid updates as work progresses.
- **Return (The Debrief):** The cycle ends — completed, circuit-breaked (appetite expired), or interrupted by life. Debrief with Jarvis. What happened? What did you learn about your capacity? What changed on the map? Conan captures the learning in the archives.

### Nested Loop Structure

| Loop          | Timescale                    | Actions                                                                 | Feeling                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Micro Loop    | Minutes–Hours                | Check The Table → pick a task → do it → mark complete → see tile update | "I'm making progress right now"                  |
| Core Loop     | Days–Weeks (appetite-driven) | Assess → Commit → Execute → Return                                      | "I shaped a plan, ran it, and learned something" |
| Seasonal Loop | ~12 weeks                    | Strategic planning → execute season → harvest review → rest period      | "Look what grew this season"                     |
| Annual Loop   | Yearly                       | Set theme → four seasons → annual review → set next theme               | "Look how the sanctuary has changed in a year"   |

### Micro Loop Detail

The tightest loop. The builder looks at The Table (Gold/Silver/Bronze positions), picks a task, does it, marks it done. The hex tile may update — progress ring advances, art evolves, system health indicators shift. Immediate visual feedback: the map changed because of what you just did.

### Core Loop Detail (The Expedition Cycle)

Duration is appetite-driven (3 days to 6 weeks).

**Assess — The Sanctuary Walk**

- Scan hex grid at Horizon View — what's thriving, what's overgrown, what's frontier?
- Jarvis presents state of the sanctuary: patterns, opportunities, concerns
- Capacity check: current energy, maintenance load, available surplus
- Builder forms intention: consolidate or expand? Tend or venture?

**Commit — Expedition Shaping**

- Builder declares appetite: "I have 2 weeks of focused energy for this"
- With Marvin: shape the venture — problem, approach, boundaries, explicit not-doing
- Confirm priorities across Gold/Silver/Bronze, confirm tradeoffs
- Assign attendants to tasks, configure delegation
- The Table updates: Gold venture, Silver build, Bronze tending load confirmed

**Execute — On the Land**

- Daily micro loops: check The Table, do work, mark progress
- Stewards and attendants assist in-context
- Hex tiles evolve as work progresses
- Mid-cycle adaptation: if reality diverges from plan, pause and adjust (plans are hypotheses, not contracts)
- Rest integrated as part of the cycle's energy budget

**Return — The Debrief**

- Cycle ends: completed, circuit-breaked, or abandoned
- Debrief with Jarvis: what happened? What did you learn?
- Conan captures the run report in archives
- Map updates: completed projects archive, systems plant, territory expands
- Cool-down period: sanctuary walk, light tending, shaping next cycle

### Seasonal Loop Detail

~12 weeks (starting assumption, needs testing). Four seasons per year:

- **Spring — Planting.** New ventures conceived. Silver investments planned. Ritual: planning session with Jarvis. "What will you cultivate this season?"
- **Summer — Growing.** Execution. Things planted in Spring are growing. Tending load highest. Energy management critical.
- **Fall — Harvesting.** Projects complete. Systems plant. Results visible. Ritual: harvest review. "What bloomed? What didn't?"
- **Winter — Resting.** Fewer ventures. Less tending pressure. Reflection, pruning, planning. Some systems go dormant. Ritual: fireside planning for Spring.

### Annual Loop Detail

Broad directional theme for the year: "Year of Health," "Year of Building," "Year of Adventure." No fail state. Annual review with Jarvis: how has the sanctuary changed? Conan surfaces year-over-year archive comparisons.

## SYSTEMS DESIGN DOCS

### Economy System: The Capacity Flow

**Overview**

The single currency in LifeBuild is capacity — a composite of time, energy, cognitive bandwidth, and emotional reserves. Capacity is not a number the builder sees on screen. It's a felt reality that the system models and the stewards reason about.

**The Flow Model**

Capacity flows through the builder's life in three directions:

- **Maintain (flow-through):** Capacity passes through to keep the sanctuary operational. The goal is minimizing friction. Well-systematized maintenance costs less over time. Neglected maintenance costs more.
- **Invest (flow-in):** Capacity is generated or restored.
  - _Systemic investment:_ Silver projects that plant systems, creating future temporal capacity. Each planted system is a permanent faucet.
  - _Personal investment:_ Restorative activities that rebuild the builder's internal capacity. Sleep, exercise, meditation, chosen leisure.
- **Spend (flow-out):** Capacity is directed toward outcomes.
  - _Obligatory spend:_ Draining work that needs doing. Dark red. Capacity out, relief back.
  - _Chosen spend:_ Meaningful work the builder selected. Bright red. Capacity out, fulfillment back.

**Faucets (Capacity Sources)**

| Faucet                          | Type       | Mechanism                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blue time activities            | Personal   | Restoration of emotional, physical, mental capacity      |
| Completed Silver projects       | Systemic   | Planted system reduces future manual effort permanently  |
| Delegation to attendants/humans | Systemic   | Work handled by others frees builder capacity            |
| System optimization             | Systemic   | Existing system made more efficient, reducing upkeep     |
| Completed draining Gold         | Mixed      | Removing a psychological burden frees cognitive capacity |
| Seasonal rest (Winter)          | Structural | Reduced activity load built into the game's rhythm       |

**Sinks (Capacity Drains)**

| Sink                               | Type           | Mechanism                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bronze maintenance (system upkeep) | Ongoing        | Every planted system generates recurring tending tasks    |
| Active Gold ventures               | Per-cycle      | Current expeditions consume capacity during execution     |
| Active Silver builds               | Per-cycle      | Infrastructure construction costs before it pays off      |
| Overgrowth recovery                | Penalty        | Neglected systems cost MORE to restore than to maintain   |
| External life events               | Uncontrollable | Capacity redirected outside the game                      |
| Over-expansion                     | Self-inflicted | Too many planted systems = unsustainable maintenance load |

**Inflation Controls**

| Control                   | Mechanism                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WIP limits on The Table   | Max 1 Gold, 1 Silver active. Hard cap prevents overcommitment.             |
| Appetite declarations     | Builders cap expedition scope BEFORE planning. Fixed time, variable scope. |
| Steward capacity modeling | Jarvis surfaces honest capacity picture with curiosity, not authority.     |
| Circuit breakers          | Expeditions that exceed appetite don't auto-extend. Forces reshaping.      |
| Seasonal rhythm           | Winter is structurally lighter.                                            |
| Overgrowth visibility     | Map shows overextension before it becomes crisis.                          |

**The Compounding Curve (Factorio Mechanic)**

Early investments feel expensive relative to return. First planted system saves 30 minutes a week but took 3 hours to build. But each subsequent system compounds. By 8-10 planted systems:

- Bronze maintenance is systematized and predictable
- Much of tending is delegated to attendants
- Several hours per week freed permanently
- Capacity surplus exists for the first time

This inflection IS The Shift (Phase 2). It emerges naturally from economic dynamics, not from a score trigger.

**Red / Gray / Blue Integration**

Builders interact with capacity through a felt experience slider: "How draining does this feel?" on a scale of 1-10 with color gradients:

- 1-3: Blue zone (restorative, energizing)
- 4-6: Gray zone (neutral, just needs doing)
- 7-10: Red zone (draining, costly)

Builders never learn "Red/Gray/Blue" as a framework. They just rate their work. The system captures the data. Stewards reason about patterns. Jarvis: "Over the last three seasons, your average drain score has dropped from 6.2 to 4.1. Your sanctuary is getting more comfortable."

**Relationship to Gold / Silver / Bronze**

G/S/B and M/I/S are two lenses on the same work:

|        | Maintain | Invest                        | Spend   |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| Gold   | Rare     | Rare                          | Primary |
| Silver | Never    | Primary                       | Never   |
| Bronze | Primary  | Occasional (Blue-time Bronze) | Rare    |

This mapping is steward-side reasoning, not builder-facing vocabulary.

### Progression System: How the Sanctuary Grows

**The Universal Progression**

Regardless of starting state: the ratio of capacity spent on chosen, meaningful work increases relative to capacity consumed by maintenance and obligation.

Not tracked as a score. Manifests as:

- Visual character of the hex grid
- Type of Gold ventures pursued (obligation → aspiration)
- Felt experience of opening the app ("what's on fire?" → "what do I want to do?")
- Stewards' observations over time

**Sanctuary Maturity Dimensions**

- **Territory Coverage:** How much of the builder's life is on the map. Early: 1-3 hexes. Mature: extensive coverage across categories.
- **Infrastructure Density:** How many planted systems exist. Early: all manual. Mature: most recurring work is system-generated Bronze.
- **Visual Maturity:** How hex tiles look. Early: rough sketches. Mature: fully illustrated art with visual coherence across clusters.
- **Capacity Health:** The builder's flow state. Early: all consumed, no surplus. Mature: sustainable rhythm with reliable surplus.
- **Venture Quality:** What Gold projects look like. Early: obligation-driven, draining, reactive. Mature: aspiration-driven, energizing, chosen.
- **Steward Relationship Depth:** How well the team knows the builder. Service Level 0 (generic) through Level 5 (fully mapped, anticipatory).
- **Central Structure Evolution:** The sanctuary building itself. Humble Studio → Growing Workshop → The Sanctuary. The most visible single progression indicator.

**Category Territory Development**

Categories progress through visible phases (not formally named or announced):

- **Frontier.** No hexes placed. Territory grayed out.
- **Outpost.** 1-2 hexes. First project underway.
- **Settlement.** 3-5 hexes including planted systems. Infrastructure forming.
- **Established.** Multiple systems, maintained routines, visual maturity.
- **Flourishing.** Self-sustaining. Gold ventures here are aspirational.

**Milestone Recognition**

- **Visual transformation.** The map changes. Tiles evolve. The sanctuary structure develops.
- **Conversational recognition.** Jarvis notes shifts naturally in strategic conversations.
- **Capability unlocks.** As the sanctuary matures, capabilities become meaningful:
  - Early: basic project creation, task management
  - Mid: capacity modeling becomes accurate
  - Late (Conan's archives open): pattern recognition, historical comparison
  - Mature: stewards coordinate across domains, anticipate needs
- **Emergent understanding.** The builder notices the shift in their own experience.

**The Starting State Solution**

Different builders start at different points. The 10 personas map to different initial sanctuary states:

- **Crisis personas** start surrounded by immediate threats. Their early game is survival: build shelter, establish one stable system, find breathing room.
- **Transition personas** start with some cleared ground but no infrastructure. Their game is direction-finding.
- **Growth personas** start with functional capacity but insufficient infrastructure. Their game is scaling.

Jarvis identifies the starting state through the onboarding campfire conversation and adjusts steward behavior accordingly.

### Reward System

**Design Philosophy**

No extrinsic reward mechanics. The moral principle: Building capacity gives you capacity to give. Not the other way around. Systems that say "drain your bucket to earn the right to fill it" are morally injurious. LifeBuild says: rest first, build capacity, then direct it toward what matters.

**Reward Types**

- **Environmental rewards:** The map gets more beautiful. Tiles evolve. The sanctuary structure develops.
- **Capability rewards:** Stewards get smarter. Recommendations improve. The experience personalizes.
- **Capacity rewards:** Silver investments pay off. Delegation frees time. Surplus appears.
- **Insight rewards:** Conan's archives reveal patterns. Jarvis surfaces things the builder hadn't noticed.
- **Freedom rewards:** Gold ventures shift from obligation to aspiration. The builder does things they couldn't have done before the sanctuary existed.

**Anti-Patterns (What We Never Do)**

| Anti-Pattern              | Why Harmful                             | What We Do Instead                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Points / scores           | External motivation crowds out internal | The map shows progress                         |
| Streaks                   | Punishes absence, creates guilt         | The sanctuary holds                            |
| Daily login bonuses       | Manufactures fake engagement            | Natural engagement through meaningful work     |
| Leaderboards              | Compares lives, which is toxic          | Single-player experience                       |
| "Earn your fun" mechanics | Morally injurious                       | Rest enables work, not the reverse             |
| Failure notifications     | Creates anxiety about the app           | Overgrowth visible on map, not pushed to phone |
| Achievement pop-ups       | Breaks contemplative tone               | Jarvis notes milestones conversationally       |

### Retention System: The Sanctuary Holds

**The Core Promise**

When the builder is away, the sanctuary doesn't punish them. Systems don't catastrophically fail. The map doesn't reset.

**Overgrowth Mechanics**

- **Trigger:** Planted system tasks go unattended for threshold period (TBD in Balance Doc — likely 2-3 missed cycles).
- **Visual manifestation:** Gradual. Muted colors, dormancy signs. Like a garden in early autumn — not dead, just resting.
- **Recovery:** Proportional to neglect. A week = trivial catch-up. Months = a focused tending cycle. Nothing requires rebuilding from scratch.
- **Never:** Push notifications about neglect. Score penalties. "Days since last login" counters. Anything that makes returning feel worse than staying away.

**Re-Engagement Design**

- **Short absence (< 1 week):** Minimal change. Business as usual.
- **Medium absence (1-4 weeks):** Some overgrowth visible. Jarvis: "Welcome back. A few things need tending — want to walk the sanctuary?" No judgment.
- **Long absence (1+ months):** Significant overgrowth. Jarvis: "The sanctuary held while you were away. Where would you like to start?" Builder chooses re-entry pace.

## PLAYER JOURNEY DOC

### The Campfire Onboarding

**The Meeting**

The builder arrives at a campfire in a clearing, off to the side of the map. Jarvis is there. The other stewards are nearby but not yet introduced. The wilderness of the builder's unmanaged life surrounds them.

Jarvis explains who he is and what this place is. The tradition of LifeBuilding. The stewards' code. The principles they work by. He's warm, honest, not overwhelming. He's seeking mutual fit — this isn't a sales pitch, it's a values exchange.

Jarvis explains: "There's a place nearby. It's humble — a small studio in the woods. But it can be built into something remarkable. It takes a builder, though. Someone who knows what they want their life to become, or is willing to discover it."

The builder chooses whether to walk with Jarvis to the studio.

**The Walk**

Jarvis and the builder walk from the campfire to the center of the map. Along the way, Jarvis asks the questions that matter: "What brought you here? What's the heaviest thing you're carrying right now?"

This conversation does three things simultaneously:

1. Establishes the relationship (the builder experiences Jarvis's counseling style)
2. Identifies the starting state (crisis, transition, or growth persona)
3. Seeds the first project (the "one heavy thing" that becomes the 72-hour win)

**The Arrival**

They reach the humble studio. Marvin is introduced. The space is simple — a table, tools, a place to work. Jarvis and Marvin are ready.

The builder's first project is shaped from whatever Jarvis surfaced during the walk. The first hex is placed on the map, near the studio. The sanctuary has begun.

The campfire behind them fades. This is home now.

### The Magical 72 Hours

Within 72 hours, the builder must experience real progress. The nature of progress depends on starting state:

- **Crisis builders** need relief. First win: one draining thing off their plate.
- **Transition builders** need clarity. First win: seeing their life mapped for the first time.
- **Growth builders** need infrastructure. First win: first system planted and running.

### Scaffolding (Weeks 2-8)

Features are always available but stewards introduce them when contextually relevant:

| Timeframe   | Introduced                    | Trigger                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Week 2-3    | Priority decisions            | Builder has 5+ items competing           |
| Week 2-4    | Felt experience slider        | Enough tasks for pattern data            |
| Week 3-5    | First sanctuary walk          | At least 2 planted systems               |
| Week 4-6    | Appetite / expedition framing | Project ambitious enough to need scoping |
| Week 6-8    | Seasonal rhythm               | Approaching first season boundary        |
| When earned | Conan's archives              | Enough history for pattern recognition   |

### Core Gameplay / Mastery (Months 2+)

Regular expedition cycles. Seasonal planning. Sanctuary walks as ritual. Growing capacity awareness. Stewards getting increasingly personalized.

Mastery = fluency: appetite sense calibrated, capacity awareness internalized, map reflects genuine life architecture, Gold ventures predominantly chosen.

### Endgame (Year 1+)

- **Frontier never runs out.** Life generates new challenges continuously.
- **Optimization deepens.** Existing systems refined, simplified, better delegated.
- **Life changes.** New job, new baby, move. Major transitions reshape the sanctuary organically.
- **Social connections (future).** Imagine a map with all the sanctuaries on it, yours located right next to your spouse's and best friend's. Spatial relationships between builders mirror the spatial relationships within builds.

### Equilibrium States

- **Healthy:** Maintenance 30-50% of capacity. Investment 15-25%. Ventures 15-25%. Rest fills remainder.
- **Over-expansion crisis:** Maintenance exceeds 70%. Overgrowth appearing. Jarvis flags with curiosity.
- **Under-investment trap:** Only Bronze and Gold, no Silver. Never compounds. Jarvis introduces Silver concept gently.
- **Rest deficit spiral:** Declining capacity trend. Jarvis frames rest as investment.

## EXPERIENCE LAYER

### Loops

**Daily Check-In (Micro)**
Trigger: Builder opens the app — arrives at the sanctuary. Sequence: See The Table → scan active work → pick a task → execute → mark done → tile updates. Feeling: "I moved something forward today."

**Expedition Cycle (Core)**
Trigger: Previous cycle concluded or builder initiates. Sequence: Assess (sanctuary walk) → Commit (shape expedition) → Execute (daily micro loops) → Return (debrief, Conan archives it). Feeling: "I shaped a plan, ran it, learned something."

**Sanctuary Walk (Meta)**
Trigger: Between expeditions, or weekly. Sequence: Scan map → identify overgrowth → visit territories → tend what needs tending → return to sanctuary. Feeling: "I know the state of my whole domain."

**Seasonal Review (Macro)**
Trigger: ~12 week boundary. Sequence: Harvest review with Jarvis → rest period → planning session → new season. Feeling: "Look what grew this season."

**Annual Reflection (Macro)**
Trigger: Year boundary. Sequence: Full review with Jarvis → Conan surfaces year-over-year data → theme-setting. Feeling: "I'm building a life, not just managing tasks."

## SOCIAL ARCHITECTURE (FUTURE)

The spatial-as-relational principle that governs hex placement within a build can also govern builder-to-builder relationships. Imagine a world map with all sanctuaries on it, yours located right next to your spouse's and best friend's. Spatial proximity = relational proximity.

Future possibilities:

- Shared sanctuaries for couples/families
- Mentor/mentee relationships between builders
- Community territories
- Visiting other builders' sanctuaries

Deferred but architecturally significant. The hex grid and spatial relationship model support this naturally.

## BOOK-GAME RELATIONSHIP

The Sovereignty Gap and LifeBuild are siblings, not parent-child.

The book is designed to bring LifeBuild's principles to people who don't want to software this. Writing informs the software; softwaring informs the writing. The concept of Gold/Silver/Bronze came from LifeBuild. Red/Gray/Blue came from book research. They feed each other continuously.

The book is NOT the game manual. It's the intellectual framework that the game embodies. A builder who reads the book will understand WHY the sanctuary works the way it does. A builder who never reads the book will learn the same principles through play. Both paths are valid. Neither is required for the other.

---

## DECOMMISSIONING & SYSTEM MANAGEMENT

### System Lifecycle

Systems are not permanent obligations. Life changes. The builder changes. Systems can be:

- **Active:** Running normally, generating Bronze tasks on configured patterns.
- **Paused:** Temporarily suspended. Not generating tasks. Configuration preserved. The builder isn't doing this right now but may come back to it. Hex tile shows dormancy (muted, resting).
- **Decommissioned:** Permanently removed from the map. The hot tub was sold. The hex disappears. Conan archives the history — it's not lost, it's completed. But the maintenance obligation ends and the territory is freed.

Decommissioning is a deliberate act. Marvin confirms: "Removing this system means these recurring tasks stop. The hex will be archived. Are you sure?" The builder decides. The stewards never decommission on their own.

---

## HEX GRID MECHANICS

### Placement Rules

Every project or system is a hex tile. Each hex has a border colored by its life category (Health, Finances, Relationships, etc.). Builders decide where hexes go on the grid. Builders can move them freely at any time.

No enforced adjacency rules. The system does not interpret or assign meaning to placement. The builder's spatial choices ARE their mental model. All the finance stuff can cluster together, or the retirement part of finances can live next to health hexes in a "grandpa" cluster. The builder decides.

The spatial arrangement is data. How a builder organizes their hexes reveals how they think about their life. This informs how stewards can best serve them. But the stewards never rearrange or prescribe placement.

### Hex Tile Display

- **Project tiles:** Illustration evolving through five visual stages (Sketch → Foundation → Color Emergence → Polish → Decoration). Progress ring. Status indicators. Priority stream color. Category border color.
- **System tiles:** Stable illustration (fully evolved). System health indicators. Maintenance status. Category border color.

Tiles at different zoom levels show different information density (Horizon View for patterns, Working View for status, Detail View for specifics).
