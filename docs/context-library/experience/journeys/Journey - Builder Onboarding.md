# Journey - Builder Onboarding

## WHAT: The Arc

From portal stranger to sanctuary resident -- the builder answers one question, the world opens, their words become territory, a team appears, and within 72 hours they have evidence that this works. The journey is a wow chain: a sequence of varied surprises that each teach the builder something about LifeBuild without ever feeling like a tutorial.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Spans:
  - [[Component - Campfire]] -- compression phase (temporary, fades after the portal)
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] -- release + wow chain territory
  - [[Room - Drafting Room]] -- project deepening on Day 2+
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] -- portal guide, ongoing counselor
  - [[Agent - Marvin]] -- wow beat, appears with work
- Systems:
  - [[System - Onboarding]] -- orchestrates the flow
  - [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] -- defines the steps
- Principles:
  - [[Principle - Action Before Explanation]] -- the builder acts before they understand
  - [[Principle - Compression and Release]] -- the portal pattern structures the entrance
  - [[Principle - The WOW Chain]] -- surprise beats are sequenced and varied
  - [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] -- real progress within 72 hours
- Unlocks:
  - [[Capability - Purpose Assignment]] -- first project gets classified
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] -- becomes visible after first project

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] -- the builder's first experience IS the teammate relationship, delivered through action
- Principle: [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] -- real progress within 72 hours
- Principle: [[Principle - Action Before Explanation]] -- the builder acts before they understand
- Principle: [[Principle - Compression and Release]] -- the portal creates the emotional foundation for everything that follows
- Driver: The onboarding must feel like entering a world, not completing a tutorial. The builder should never feel taught. By the end of the first session, they should be able to point at their map and say "that's mine."

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Duration:** First session (5 minutes) + 3-day deepening

**Design refinement (2026-02-26):** Journey redesigned from MI posture sequence to wow chain choreography. The campfire conversation is replaced by a compression phase with one question. The wow chain delivers the mental model through action, not explanation. Source: Power of the Portal.

**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No onboarding exists. Current app opens to basic Life Map.

## HOW: The WOW Chain

Each beat has: the moment (what happens), the emotional target (what the builder feels), the teaching (what the builder learns about LifeBuild), the variety type (what KIND of surprise), and design constraints (what makes it land vs. breaks it).

| Beat                           | Moment                                                                                                              | Emotional Target                  | Teaching                                            | Variety Type            | Design Constraints                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #0: Compression                | Intimate space. Jarvis. One question: "What's something you've been meaning to deal with?" Builder types answer.    | "I'm intrigued."                  | "Someone is listening."                             | -- (loading the spring) | Must feel enclosed, intimate. Map NOT visible. ~60 seconds max.                                                                                                                                             |
| #1: The Portal                 | View expands. Map reveals -- open sky, terrain, sanctuary at center.                                                | "Oh -- there's a world here."     | "This is spatial. There's a whole world."           | Spatial                 | Must produce contrast with compression. The builder couldn't predict this. If it feels like a page loading, the compression failed.                                                                         |
| #2: Words Become World         | Builder's answer materializes as a hex on the map. Their words are becoming territory.                              | "My words are becoming real."     | "My input becomes part of the world."               | Personal                | Must feel like creation, not data entry. The transition from words to hex is the product's entire pitch in one moment. No loading spinner. No generic hex. The builder's words should be visible/reflected. |
| #3: The Team                   | Marvin appears. Already breaking the problem into steps. "Here are three things you could do -- which feels right?" | "I have a team."                  | "AI teammates do actual work on my actual problem." | Relational              | Marvin must arrive with work already done, not asking questions. The builder watches a teammate act, not introduce themselves.                                                                              |
| #4: Placement                  | Builder places the hex on the map. Chooses where it goes.                                                           | "This is mine. I chose."          | "I control the space. The map is mine."             | Agency                  | Manual placement, not algorithmic. The builder's choice is respected.                                                                                                                                       |
| #5: Something Moves (optional) | An attendant picks up a task. "I'll look into that for you."                                                        | "Something is already happening." | "The team works even when I'm not here."            | Scalar                  | Only if the task is genuinely actionable. Don't fake progress.                                                                                                                                              |

### The Deepening Arc (Days 2-3)

| Phase                   | Entry                   | Activities                                                                                                    | Emotional Target               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Day 1 (after wow chain) | First session continues | Complete first task. Explore the map. Come back and it's still there.                                         | "I did something real."        |
| Day 2                   | Builder returns         | Jarvis references what happened (Me/You/Us now applies -- shared context exists). Second project with Marvin. | "They remember. I have help."  |
| Day 3                   | Builder is ready        | Sorting Room. Work at Hand. The Table.                                                                        | "I know what to do each week." |
| 72-Hour Win             | Tasks underway          | Starting-state-appropriate win achieved.                                                                      | "This actually works."         |

### Starting State Wins

- **Crisis builders** need relief. First win: one draining thing off their plate.
- **Transition builders** need clarity. First win: seeing their life mapped for the first time.
- **Growth builders** need infrastructure. First win: first system planted and running.

### Success Signals

- Builder returns to the app within 48 hours of first visit
- First project has at least one completed task within 72 hours
- Builder voluntarily engages with Marvin on task shaping (not just Jarvis)
- Builder places a second hex (unprompted)

### Failure Modes

- **Compression fails** -- campfire doesn't feel intimate, or the map is visible too early. No contrast = no gasp.
- **Wow chain breaks** -- gap between beats where nothing happens. Deflation. Blank canvas problem.
- **All wows same type** -- five spatial reveals = diminishing returns. Variety is essential.
- **Builder's words don't become territory** -- the hex materializes but feels like a form submission, not creation. The words-to-hex transition must feel magical.
- **Marvin explains instead of acts** -- Marvin should arrive WITH work done, not asking questions. The builder watches a teammate in action.
- **No tangible output** -- if the builder leaves the first session with nothing on the map, the 72-hour clock is losing.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Crisis builder (Drowning Executive)

- Beat #0: Builder opens the app, sees intimate campfire space. Types "I haven't slept properly in months, everything at work is on fire."
- Beat #1: Portal opens. Map reveals. Builder gasps.
- Beat #2: Their words become a hex -- "Sleep & Recovery" territory materializing on the map.
- Beat #3: Marvin appears: "Here are three things you could do -- set a bedtime alarm, block off wind-down time, or audit your evening screen time. Which feels right?"
- Beat #4: Builder places the hex in Health territory on the map.
- 72-hour win: Builder has slept at their target bedtime 2 of 3 nights.

**Example 2:** Growth builder (System Builder)

- Beat #0: Builder types "I'm good at my job but my personal life is unmanaged chaos."
- Beat #1: Portal opens. Map reveals -- a world, not a tool.
- Beat #2: Words become a hex -- "Personal Life Systems" on the map.
- Beat #3: Marvin appears with three actionable angles already broken down.
- Beat #4: Builder places the hex, choosing the location deliberately.
- 72-hour win: First system planted and generating its first Bronze task.

### Anti-Examples

- **Full conversation before showing the map** -- violates Action Before Explanation. One question, then the world opens.
- **Making the campfire permanent** -- threshold, not fixture.
- **Tutorial overlay explaining features** -- the wow chain IS the tutorial. The builder learns through surprises, not instructions.
- **Identical onboarding for all builders** -- same wow chain, but the deepening (Days 2-3) adapts to starting state.
