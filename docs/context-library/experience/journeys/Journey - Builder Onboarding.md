# Journey - Builder Onboarding

## WHAT: The Arc

From campfire stranger to sanctuary resident — the builder meets Jarvis at a fire in the wilderness, walks to the humble studio, meets Marvin, places their first hex, and achieves a meaningful win within 72 hours. By the end, the builder has a home, a team, and evidence that this works.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Spans:
  - [[Component - Campfire]] — the meeting point (temporary, disappears after the walk)
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — the walk to the studio, first hex placement
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — first strategic conversation with Jarvis
  - [[Room - Drafting Room]] — first project creation with Marvin
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — guides the walk, establishes the relationship, identifies starting state
  - [[Agent - Marvin]] — introduced at the studio, shapes the first project
- Systems:
  - [[System - Onboarding]] — orchestrates the flow
  - [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] — defines the steps
- Unlocks:
  - [[Capability - Purpose Assignment]] — first project gets classified
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] — becomes visible after first project

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — the builder's first experience IS the teammate relationship
- Principle: [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] — real progress within 72 hours or the builder is lost
- Principle: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — Jarvis elicits, never interrogates
- Driver: The onboarding journey must establish three things simultaneously: the relationship (builder trusts the stewards), the starting state (crisis/transition/growth), and the first project (the "heavy thing" that becomes the 72-hour win).

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Duration:** 1-3 days (campfire to 72-hour win)
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No campfire onboarding exists. The current app opens to a basic Life Map or Drafting Room. No walk mechanic, no Jarvis onboarding conversation, no starting state identification, no 72-hour win tracking. The [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] card describes the intended flow but none of it is built.

## HOW: Progression

### Phases

| Phase         | Entry Condition                  | Activities                                                                                                        | Transition Trigger                                  | Target Feeling                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| The Meeting   | Builder opens app for first time | Arrive at campfire; Jarvis explains the tradition, the stewards, the sanctuary code                               | Builder agrees to walk with Jarvis                  | "I'm intrigued. These people are different."  |
| The Walk      | Builder accepts invitation       | Walk from campfire toward studio; Jarvis asks "What brought you here? What's the heaviest thing you're carrying?" | Arrive at the studio                                | "Someone actually listened."                  |
| The Arrival   | Reach the studio                 | Meet Marvin; studio is simple but warm; campfire fades behind them                                                | Builder shapes first project from "the heavy thing" | "This is home now. Modest, but mine."         |
| First Project | Project shaped                   | Place first hex on the map near the studio; begin executing first tasks                                           | Meaningful win achieved                             | "I did something real about the heavy thing." |
| 72-Hour Win   | First tasks underway             | Achieve starting-state-appropriate win (see below)                                                                | Builder has evidence this works                     | "This actually works."                        |

### Starting State Wins

The nature of the 72-hour win depends on the builder's starting state (identified during the Walk):

- **Crisis builders** need relief. First win: one draining thing off their plate.
- **Transition builders** need clarity. First win: seeing their life mapped for the first time.
- **Growth builders** need infrastructure. First win: first system planted and running.

### Success Signals

- Builder returns to the app within 48 hours of first visit
- First project has at least one completed task within 72 hours
- Builder voluntarily engages with Marvin on task shaping (not just Jarvis)
- Builder places a second hex (unprompted)

### Failure Modes

- **Jarvis overwhelms** — too much philosophy, not enough doing. The walk should feel like a conversation, not a lecture.
- **No tangible output** — if the builder leaves the onboarding with nothing on the map, the 72-hour clock is already losing.
- **The stewards feel robotic** — the onboarding is a values exchange, not a tutorial. If Jarvis sounds like a chatbot, the whole conceit fails.
- **Forced self-disclosure** — Jarvis asks open questions but never pushes. If the builder doesn't want to share the "heavy thing," Jarvis pivots gracefully.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Crisis builder (Drowning Executive)

- Phase: The Walk
- Builder's state: Overwhelmed, skeptical, testing the waters
- What happens: Jarvis asks "What's heaviest right now?" → builder says "I haven't slept properly in months, everything at work is on fire" → Jarvis identifies crisis state → at the studio, Marvin helps shape a tiny first project: "Establish a sleep routine" → one task: "Set a bedtime alarm for 10pm tonight" → builder does it → first hex placed (Health territory)
- 72-hour win: Builder has slept at their target bedtime 2 of 3 nights

**Example 2:** Growth builder (System Builder)

- Phase: The Walk
- Builder's state: Capable but scattered, ready for infrastructure
- What happens: Jarvis asks "What brought you here?" → builder says "I'm good at my job but my personal life is unmanaged chaos" → Jarvis identifies growth state → at the studio, Marvin helps shape: "Automate monthly bill payments" → 4 tasks → builder completes 2 in first session → Finance hex placed
- 72-hour win: First system planted and generating its first Bronze task

### Anti-Examples

- **Skipping the campfire and dropping builders into an empty map** — the campfire is a threshold moment. Without the values exchange, the builder has no relationship with the stewards and no understanding of why the sanctuary works the way it does.
- **Making the campfire a permanent fixture** — the campfire is a beginning, not a place to return. Once the builder walks to the studio, the campfire fades. There is no going back. The sanctuary is home.
- **Forcing all builders through identical onboarding** — crisis builders need relief, transition builders need clarity, growth builders need infrastructure. Same journey, different emphasis.
