# Journey - Sanctuary Progression

## WHAT: The Arc

From survival to sovereignty — the builder progresses through three phases of sanctuary development. In Phase 1 (Survival Building), most capacity goes to tending and obligation. In Phase 2 (The Shift), systems compound and capacity surplus appears for the first time. In Phase 3 (Directed Living), the sanctuary serves the builder instead of the other way around. The journey is universal regardless of starting state; the starting point differs but the direction is the same.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Spans:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — the hex grid visually reflects progression
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Jarvis notes phase transitions
  - [[Room - Drafting Room]] — project types shift across phases
  - [[Room - Sorting Room]] — Gold selections shift from obligation to aspiration
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — recognizes and names phase transitions
  - [[Agent - Marvin]] — project types and complexity evolve with phases
  - [[Agent - Conan]] — archives unlock in mid-to-late phases; provides historical comparison
- Systems:
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — the economic dynamics that drive The Shift
  - [[System - Overgrowth]] — visual indicators that correlate to journey phase
- Unlocks:
  - Early: basic project creation, task management, The Table
  - Mid: capacity modeling, felt experience patterns, priority sophistication
  - Late: [[Agent - Conan]]'s archives, pattern recognition, historical comparison
  - Mature: steward coordination, anticipatory guidance, cross-domain insight

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — the process itself drives the progression
- Strategy: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] — the map IS the progression indicator
- Principle: [[Principle - Protect Transformation]] — Gold ventures shift from obligation to aspiration
- Driver: The universal direction is that the ratio of capacity spent on chosen, meaningful work increases relative to capacity consumed by maintenance and obligation. Not tracked as a score — manifested as visual character, venture quality, and felt experience.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP (implicit) through Future (explicit)
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Duration:** Months to years. No fixed timeline.
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** The progression is partially implicit in the current app — builders create projects and complete tasks, which could be seen as Phase 1 activity. But no phase recognition, no Shift detection, no visual progression tied to maturity, and no steward acknowledgment of transitions. The sanctuary structure evolution (Humble Studio → Growing Workshop → The Sanctuary) is entirely unbuilt.

## HOW: Progression

### Phases

| Phase | Entry Condition | Activities | Transition Trigger | Target Feeling |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Phase 1: Survival Building | Builder begins (any starting state) | Tending, first systems, basic project execution. Most capacity consumed by obligation. | Systems begin compounding; capacity surplus appears | "I'm finally doing something about this." |
| Phase 2: The Shift | 8-10 planted systems; Bronze systematized; several hours/week freed | Efficient tending, delegation to attendants, surplus directed to chosen ventures. Gold shifts from obligation to aspiration. | Capacity routinely exceeds obligation; Gold ventures are predominantly chosen | "I have room to breathe. What do I want to do with it?" |
| Phase 3: Directed Living | Sustainable rhythm with reliable surplus; Gold is predominantly aspirational | Full strategic partnership with stewards, cross-domain insight, refinement and optimization | (No end state — life continues generating frontier) | "My life works for me." |

### Sanctuary Maturity Dimensions

Progression manifests across seven dimensions (not tracked as scores — observed by stewards and visible on the map):

1. **Territory Coverage** — How much of the builder's life is on the map (1-3 hexes → extensive)
2. **Infrastructure Density** — How many planted systems exist (all manual → mostly automated)
3. **Visual Maturity** — How hex tiles look (rough sketches → fully illustrated art)
4. **Capacity Health** — The builder's flow state (all consumed → sustainable surplus)
5. **Venture Quality** — What Gold projects look like (obligation-driven → aspiration-driven)
6. **Steward Relationship Depth** — How well the team knows the builder (Service Level 0 → Level 5)
7. **Central Structure Evolution** — The sanctuary building itself (Humble Studio → Growing Workshop → The Sanctuary)

### Category Territory Development

Individual life categories progress through visible phases:

| Phase | Hex Count | Character |
| ----- | --------- | --------- |
| Frontier | 0 | Grayed out. Unexplored. |
| Outpost | 1-2 | First project underway. |
| Settlement | 3-5 | Systems forming. Infrastructure emerging. |
| Established | 5+ | Maintained routines. Visual maturity. |
| Flourishing | Many | Self-sustaining. Gold ventures here are aspirational. |

### Success Signals

- **Phase 1 → 2:** Drain score trending down. Bronze maintenance becoming predictable. First truly chosen Gold venture.
- **Phase 2 → 3:** Gold ventures predominantly aspirational. Stewards anticipating needs. Builder initiating sessions rather than responding to prompts.

### Failure Modes

- **Stuck in Phase 1** — perpetual tending without system investment. Jarvis gently introduces Silver concept. ([[Dynamic - Silver Avoidance]])
- **False Shift** — capacity surplus appears but is immediately consumed by over-expansion. ([[Dynamic - Over-Expansion]])
- **Phase 3 plateau** — sanctuary runs well but builder disengages. ([[Dynamic - The Plateau]])

### Examples

**Example 1:** Crisis builder reaching The Shift

- Phase: Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition
- Builder's state: Started as Drowning Executive. 8 months in. 9 planted systems. Bronze is routine.
- What happens: Builder opens LifeBuild and for the first time has genuine surplus. Picks a Gold venture that excites them — "Learn to sail" — not an obligation but a desire. Jarvis notes it: "Your work looks different lately. More choosing, less reacting." Builder recognizes: this is The Shift.

**Example 2:** Growth builder reaching Directed Living

- Phase: Phase 2 → Phase 3 transition
- Builder's state: Started as Optimization Engineer. 14 months in. 15+ systems. Map is extensive.
- What happens: Annual review with Jarvis reveals all Gold ventures in the past two seasons were purely aspirational. Drain score stable at 3.2. Builder reflects: "My life works for me." Conan surfaces: "Last year, 60% of your Gold was obligation. This year, 90% is chosen." The sanctuary structure has evolved to its full expression.

### Anti-Examples

- **Announcing phase transitions with achievement pop-ups** — transitions are recognized conversationally by Jarvis, not with fanfare. The builder should feel the shift, not be told about it.
- **Treating phases as levels to unlock** — phases describe an emergent pattern, not a game mechanic. Builders don't "level up" — they notice that their experience has changed.
- **Defining a fixed timeline** — one builder's Shift happens at 6 months, another's at 18. Starting state, life circumstances, and engagement patterns all vary. No "you should be at Phase 2 by now."
