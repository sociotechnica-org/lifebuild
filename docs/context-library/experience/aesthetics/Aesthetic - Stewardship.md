# Aesthetic - Stewardship

## WHAT: The Feeling

"I'm tending my domain. What needs attention is clear, and tending it feels good."

## WHERE: Moments

- Contexts:
  - [[Loop - Sanctuary Walk]] — scanning the domain and tending overgrowth
  - [[Loop - Daily Check-In]] — handling Bronze maintenance tasks
  - [[System - Bronze Stack]] — tending planted systems via generated tasks
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — seeing the hex grid and noticing what's thriving vs. dormant

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — maintenance is sacred, not menial
- Principle: [[Principle - Visibility Creates Agency]] — visible territory state creates stewardship agency
- Driver: Bronze work and system maintenance can feel like drudgery or like domain stewardship. The difference is aesthetic. When tending feels like walking your garden — noticing what's thriving, pruning what's overgrown, watering what's dry — it becomes satisfying rather than tedious. The Stewardship aesthetic transforms obligation into craft.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** Bronze tasks exist but without the visual and experiential context that creates Stewardship. No overgrowth indicators, no sanctuary walk mechanic, no territory health visualization, no tending-specific feedback loops. Bronze currently feels like a task list, not domain stewardship.

## HOW: Design

### Reinforced By

- Sanctuary walk at a quiet, contemplative pace — not rushing through a checklist
- Holistic view at Horizon zoom — seeing the whole domain at once, noticing patterns
- Overgrowth that looks like gentle dormancy, not damage — muted colors, autumn-like, natural
- Easy path from "noticing" to "tending" — see overgrowth, click to address, quick resolution
- System health indicators that feel like garden health — "this system is running well" vs. "needs attention" vs. "dormant"

### Broken By

- Bronze tasks presented as a flat queue — no spatial context, no domain connection, just a list
- Maintenance that feels punitive — "You missed 3 system tasks!" instead of "This garden corner needs watering"
- Overgrowth presented as failure — red alerts, warning icons, guilt language
- No visual distinction between maintained and neglected areas — if everything looks the same regardless of tending, the feedback loop breaks
- Forced tending cadence — "You must tend your systems every 3 days" is obligation, not stewardship

### Examples

**Example 1:** Sunday sanctuary walk

- Context: Builder takes a leisurely sanctuary walk between expeditions
- Builder feels: "Tending my domain" — pans across Horizon View, notices most territories are green/maintained, one small cluster shows gentle dormancy signs. Zooms in, handles two quick Bronze tasks, zooms back out. Domain feels tended.
- Design creates this via: Quiet visual language for overgrowth, easy in-context task handling, holistic Horizon View showing territory health patterns

**Example 2:** Noticing overgrowth on a hex

- Context: Builder sees a Health hex with muted colors during a check-in
- Builder feels: "That needs attention" — not panic, not guilt. Just awareness. Clicks the hex, sees the exercise system has 2 missed cycles. Reschedules. Colors begin to return.
- Design creates this via: Gradual muted-color overgrowth (not red alerts), proportional recovery (2 missed cycles = trivial catch-up), no push notification about the neglect

### Anti-Examples

- **Treating tending as a chore the builder must optimize away** — some maintenance is genuine stewardship. Not everything should be delegated. The builder who tends their own garden connects with their domain differently than one who delegates everything.
- **Guilt language for neglected areas** — "You haven't tended Health in 12 days!" is not stewardship. Stewardship is noticing gently and choosing to tend.
- **Tending as prerequisite for other activities** — "You can't start a Gold venture until all Bronze is current" is gating, not stewardship. The builder chooses when and how to tend.
