# Aesthetic - Being Known

## WHAT: The Feeling

"My counselor gets me. My history has patterns worth knowing."

## WHERE: Moments

- Contexts:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — sitting with Jarvis for strategic conversation
  - [[Zone - Archives]] — visiting Conan and discovering patterns in personal history
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — when Jarvis references history, spots patterns, asks questions that show understanding
  - [[Agent - Conan]] — when Conan surfaces surprising insights from the archives
  - [[Standard - Service Levels]] — as service level deepens, stewards know more

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — teammates know you; tools don't
- Principle: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — knowledge is earned through relationship, not extracted through forms
- Driver: The difference between a tool and a teammate is that the teammate remembers. Being Known is the aesthetic that makes stewards feel like people you work with, not interfaces you use. It compounds over time — the longer the relationship, the more the builder feels understood.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP through Future
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No Jarvis, no Conan, no archives, no service levels. The agent system (Marvin in Drafting Room and Sorting Room) has basic conversation context but no long-term memory, no pattern recognition, and no personalization beyond the current session. Being Known depends on the full agent architecture being mature.

## HOW: Design

### Reinforced By

- Jarvis referencing specific history: "Last time you tried something like this, you burned out in week 2. What's different this time?"
- Conan surfacing unexpected patterns: "Your drain scores spike every September. Three years running."
- Stewards asking questions that show they've been paying attention — not generic prompts
- Service level progression — the stewards genuinely get smarter about this specific builder over time
- Pattern recognition that the builder couldn't see themselves — the archives reveal what lived experience obscures

### Broken By

- Generic advice that could apply to anyone — "Have you tried time blocking?" destroys Being Known
- Robotic or formulaic tone — stewards must sound like people who know the builder, not chatbots with context injection
- Asking questions the steward should already know — if Jarvis asks "What are your priorities?" when The Charter documents them, the relationship feels hollow
- Empty archives — Conan's value requires data. If the builder visits and there's nothing useful, Being Known is broken for that moment
- Over-personalization that feels surveillance-like — there's a line between "my counselor remembers" and "my counselor tracked everything." The aesthetic is warmth, not monitoring.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Jarvis in a strategic conversation

- Context: Builder is considering a career change. Sitting with Jarvis in Council Chamber.
- Builder feels: "My counselor gets me" — Jarvis references the builder's Charter values, notes that this consideration has been circling for two seasons, connects it to a pattern Conan flagged about recurring Career territory restlessness
- Design creates this via: Charter integration, conversation history, cross-agent knowledge synthesis, Jarvis's warm and observant voice

**Example 2:** Conan's archives surprise

- Context: Builder visits archives for the first time after a year of active use
- Builder feels: "My history has patterns worth knowing" — Conan shows that the builder's most successful projects all shared a characteristic: they were scoped to 2-week appetites. Longer ones consistently circuit-breaked. Shorter ones felt unsatisfying.
- Design creates this via: Historical data analysis, pattern recognition across completed expeditions, Conan's matter-of-fact librarian voice delivering genuinely useful insight

### Anti-Examples

- **Stewards that forget between sessions** — if Jarvis doesn't remember last week's conversation, the relationship resets and Being Known is impossible.
- **Personalization that feels like a marketing algorithm** — "Builders who did X also did Y" is recommendation engine logic, not counselor knowledge. Being Known is relational, not statistical.
- **Stewards referencing data the builder didn't share** — if Jarvis mentions something the builder didn't volunteer, trust breaks. All steward knowledge must trace to builder-provided information or builder-generated activity within the sanctuary.
