# Aesthetic - Accomplishment

## WHAT: The Feeling

"I built that. The sanctuary grew because of what I did."

## WHERE: Moments

- Contexts:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — hex tile transformation on project completion
  - [[Component - Hex Tile]] — visual evolution through image evolution stages
  - [[Loop - Daily Check-In]] — marking a task complete and seeing the tile update
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — Return phase (seeing what changed on the map)
  - [[Primitive - System]] — creating a system and seeing Bronze tasks flow immediately

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] — the map visibly reflects work done
- Principle: [[Principle - Visibility Creates Agency]] — visible accomplishment reinforces the builder's sense of capability
- Driver: The builder needs evidence that their work matters — not abstract evidence (points, percentages) but tangible evidence (the map changed, the tile evolved, a new system generates tasks automatically). Accomplishment is the aesthetic that closes the effort-reward loop without extrinsic gamification.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** Task completion exists. Project completion is tracked. But hex tile visual evolution (image evolution stages), map-level visual updates on completion, system creation with automatic Bronze task generation, and progress rings are not implemented. The "I built that" feeling depends on visual feedback that doesn't yet exist.

## HOW: Design

### Reinforced By

- Hex tile transformation on project completion — the tile visually evolves (image evolution stages: Sketch → Foundation → Color Emergence → Polish → Decoration)
- Map-level updates visible at Horizon View — zooming out shows that the landscape changed
- System creation with immediate effect — creating a system in the Drafting Room plants it on the map, and it starts generating Bronze tasks immediately; new infrastructure appears on the map
- Progress rings on active project tiles — visible forward motion even before completion
- Jarvis noting milestones conversationally — "That's the third system you've planted this season"

### Broken By

- Anticlimactic completion — finishing a project and nothing visible changes. The map must react.
- Invisible systems — planting a system that doesn't appear on the map or generate visible task flow
- Achievement pop-ups or score increments — extrinsic reward mechanics cheapen genuine accomplishment. The map IS the reward.
- Delayed visual feedback — if tile evolution happens on a schedule rather than tied to completion, the accomplishment-to-feedback link breaks
- Dismissive steward responses — if Marvin says "OK, marked done. What's next?" without acknowledging the achievement, Accomplishment is undermined

### Examples

**Example 1:** Completing a Gold project

- Context: Builder finishes their first aspirational Gold venture: "Write conference proposal"
- Builder feels: "I built that" — the Career hex tile evolves from Foundation to Color Emergence stage. The progress ring completes. Jarvis mentions it in the next Council session: "You submitted that proposal. How did it feel?"
- Design creates this via: Image evolution tied to project completion, progress ring animation, conversational recognition from Jarvis

**Example 2:** Creating a system

- Context: Builder creates system "Monthly bill payment tracking" in the Drafting Room. They already manage bills manually but want to formalize it as recurring infrastructure.
- Builder feels: "The sanctuary grew" — a new System hex tile appears in the Finance cluster. The first Bronze task generates immediately: "Review auto-payment confirmations." The infrastructure is real.
- Design creates this via: System tile creation from Drafting Room, immediate Bronze task generation on planting, visual distinction between Project tiles and System tiles

### Anti-Examples

- **Points or XP for completing projects** — the tile evolution IS the reward. Adding numbers on top converts intrinsic accomplishment into extrinsic reward-seeking.
- **Leaderboards comparing builder progress** — accomplishment is personal. "You completed 3 projects this month" is fine. "You're in the top 10% of builders" is toxic.
- **"Earn your fun" gating** — accomplishment should never be a prerequisite for access to features or rest. The builder rests when they need to, builds when they choose to.
