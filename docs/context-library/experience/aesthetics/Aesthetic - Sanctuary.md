# Aesthetic - Sanctuary

## WHAT: The Feeling

"This is my place. It holds when I'm away. It grows when I tend it. It's becoming something."

## WHERE: Moments

- Contexts:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — opening the app and seeing the familiar map
  - [[Loop - Sanctuary Walk]] — walking the domain
  - [[Loop - Daily Check-In]] — arriving at the sanctuary each session
  - [[Component - Hex Tile]] — tiles that visually evolve with care
  - [[Structure - Hex Grid]] — the spatial arrangement as externalized mental model

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] — the map IS the sanctuary; seeing it creates belonging
- Principle: [[Principle - Protect Transformation]] — the sanctuary protects what the builder is becoming
- Driver: The builder needs to feel that this is a place, not an app. A place they built, a place that reflects their care, a place that persists whether they visit or not. The sanctuary aesthetic is what makes LifeBuild feel like home instead of a tool.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP (partial) through Future (full)
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** The Life Map exists as a hex grid with tiles. But visual evolution (image evolution stages), the central sanctuary structure, overgrowth indicators, and the "warm return" experience after absence are not implemented. The map currently feels more like a dashboard than a sanctuary.

## HOW: Design

### Reinforced By

- Familiar map layout that persists across sessions — the builder's spatial arrangement is always where they left it
- Warm palette and visual language — wood, glass, stone, Studio Ghibli workshop warmth
- Sanctuary structure at map center that visually evolves (Humble Studio → Growing Workshop → The Sanctuary)
- Steward presence — Jarvis is there when you enter the sanctuary structure
- Gentle overgrowth on return — the garden grew, it wasn't destroyed
- Hex tiles that show care history — tiles tended recently look maintained; neglected tiles show natural dormancy

### Broken By

- Loading screens or empty states on app open — the builder should arrive at their sanctuary, not wait for it
- Notification counts or badge alerts — the sanctuary is a place to visit, not a thing that demands attention
- Catastrophic decay on absence — if the builder returns to ruin, the sanctuary failed its core promise
- Generic or templated appearance — the sanctuary must feel like THIS builder's place, not "a productivity app"
- Guilt language — "You've been away for 12 days" violates the holding aesthetic

### Examples

**Example 1:** Daily return

- Context: Builder opens the app on a weekday morning
- Builder feels: "Coming home to my sanctuary" — the map is where they left it, warm colors, the studio/workshop at center, their territories arranged the way they chose
- Design creates this via: Persistent spatial layout, warm visual language, no alerts or notifications competing for attention

**Example 2:** Return after two-week absence

- Context: Builder was traveling and didn't open the app for 14 days
- Builder feels: "It's still here" — the sanctuary held. Some gentle overgrowth on a few hexes, but everything is intact. Jarvis: "Welcome back. A few things need tending — want to walk the sanctuary?"
- Design creates this via: Gradual overgrowth (muted colors, dormancy signs — not damage), welcoming steward tone, no punishment mechanics

**Example 3:** Seeing the sanctuary evolve

- Context: Builder has been actively building for 6 months; the central structure transitions from Humble Studio to Growing Workshop
- Builder feels: "This place is becoming something" — the evolution is visual and gradual, noticed rather than announced
- Design creates this via: Central structure visual evolution tied to maturity dimensions, not gamified triggers

### Anti-Examples

- **Push notifications about the sanctuary's state** — the sanctuary doesn't reach out. The builder visits when they're ready. No "Your garden needs watering!" alerts.
- **Resetting or degrading the map on inactivity** — the sanctuary holds. Period. Overgrowth is gentle and recoverable. Nothing requires rebuilding from scratch.
- **Achievement pop-ups when the sanctuary evolves** — evolution is noticed, not announced. The builder sees the structure has changed and feels pride. A popup would cheapen it.
