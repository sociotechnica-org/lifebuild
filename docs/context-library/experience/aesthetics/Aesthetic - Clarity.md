# Aesthetic - Clarity

## WHAT: The Feeling

"I know what matters. This is doable."

## WHERE: Moments

- Contexts:
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] — seeing Gold/Silver/Bronze positions clearly laid out
  - [[Room - Sorting Room]] — priority decisions with Marvin
  - [[Room - Drafting Room]] — project shaping with bounded scope
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — Commit phase (expedition shaping)
  - [[Capability - Three-Stream Filtering]] — filtered priority views

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — clarity is the output of good process
- Principle: [[Principle - Familiarity Over Function]] — priorities presented in a way that feels natural
- Driver: The builder is overwhelmed not because they're incompetent but because modern life is genuinely complex. Clarity is the antidote — the feeling that complexity has been tamed into manageable, prioritized work. When the builder sees The Table with clear positions, the chaos recedes.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** The Sorting Room exists with stream-filtered views and priority selection. The Table as a persistent overlay does not exist. Expedition shaping with bounded appetite is not implemented. Clarity exists in fragments but not as a cohesive felt experience.

## HOW: Design

### Reinforced By

- Clean layout on The Table — max 1 Gold, 1 Silver, constrained Bronze. Not everything, just what matters
- Clear scope boundaries — Marvin shapes work with explicit "not-doing" declarations
- Appetite framing — "I have 2 weeks for this" not "I need to finish this"
- Manageable task decomposition — objectives broken into 15min-2hr units
- Priority scores that inform without dictating — the math suggests, the builder decides

### Broken By

- Overflow — too many competing items visible at once. The Table should never feel like a backlog
- Unbounded scope — projects without clear boundaries create the opposite of clarity
- Competing urgency signals — everything marked "urgent" means nothing is
- Information overload in priority views — Marvin should present the right candidates, not all candidates
- Auto-generated priorities that feel algorithmic — if the builder can't explain why something is on The Table, clarity is broken

### Examples

**Example 1:** Weekly planning with Marvin

- Context: Builder enters Sorting Room, Marvin presents Gold candidates
- Builder feels: "I know what matters" — three candidates ranked by importance, each with a one-line reason, one clearly resonating
- Design creates this via: Stream-filtered view showing only relevant candidates, priority scores as context not commands, Marvin asking "Which of these matters most if you can only move one forward?"

**Example 2:** Expedition shaping

- Context: Builder has chosen their Gold, now shaping the expedition with Marvin
- Builder feels: "This is doable and well-planned" — 5 tasks, 2-week appetite, explicit boundaries
- Design creates this via: Appetite declaration before planning (fixed time, variable scope), structured task breakdown, explicit "not-doing" list, Marvin's structured but flexible approach

### Anti-Examples

- **Showing everything the builder could possibly work on** — clarity requires ruthless filtering. The Table exists precisely to hide the 95% and show the 5%.
- **Priority algorithms that override builder judgment** — "The math says you should pick this one" destroys clarity. The builder must own their priorities for them to feel clear.
- **Undifferentiated task lists** — a flat list of 47 tasks is the opposite of clarity. Stream filtering, kanban structure, and The Table exist to prevent this.
