# Loop - Annual Reflection

## WHAT: The Cycle

The broadest engagement loop — once per year, the builder reviews how the sanctuary has changed, sets a directional theme for the coming year, and begins fresh seasonal cycles. Conan surfaces year-over-year archive comparisons. This is where "I'm building a life, not just managing tasks" lives.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Timescale: annual
- Rooms:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — annual review with Jarvis
  - [[Zone - Archives]] — year-over-year comparisons from Conan
- Capabilities:
  - [[Capability - Purpose Assignment]] — annual theme setting
- Systems: (none beyond existing infrastructure)
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — facilitates annual review and theme-setting
  - [[Agent - Conan]] — surfaces year-over-year data, archive comparisons
- Contains:
  - [[Loop - Seasonal Review]] — four seasons compose a year
- Part of:
  - [[Journey - Sanctuary Progression]] — annual reflections mark the largest progression milestones

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — annual rhythm provides the longest-range perspective
- Principle: [[Principle - Visibility Creates Agency]] — seeing year-over-year change creates deep agency
- Driver: Without a long-range view, builders lose the forest for the trees. The annual reflection is where the builder sees the full arc of their sanctuary's development — not individual tasks, but the shape of a life being intentionally built.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Future
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No annual mechanic exists. Depends on mature seasonal cycles, which depend on mature expedition cycles. This is the last loop to become meaningful — it requires a full year of data before the reflection carries weight.

## HOW: The Cycle

### Phases

1. **Review** — Full review with Jarvis. How has the sanctuary changed in a year?
2. **Remember** — Conan surfaces year-over-year archive comparisons, pattern evolution
3. **Theme** — Set a broad directional theme: "Year of Health," "Year of Building," "Year of Adventure"
4. **Begin** — First seasonal cycle of the new year starts

### Entry

Year boundary. No fail state — if the builder doesn't do an annual review, nothing breaks. The sanctuary continues.

### Completion

The builder has perspective on their year's arc and a directional theme for the next. The sanctuary's visual state tells the story.

### Target Feeling

"I'm building a life, not just managing tasks."

### Examples

**Example 1:** First annual reflection

- Trigger: Builder reaches one-year mark
- Cycle: Jarvis opens review → "A year ago you arrived at a campfire with one heavy thing. Now you have 12 hexes, 4 planted systems, and your first purely aspirational Gold." → Conan surfaces data: "Your average drain score went from 7.1 to 4.3. Your Gold ventures shifted from obligation to aspiration in Season 3." → Builder sets theme: "Year of Creative Projects" → first Spring planning begins
- Builder feels: "I actually built something real over this year."

**Example 2:** Mature builder annual

- Trigger: Third annual review
- Cycle: Jarvis opens review → "The sanctuary is largely self-sustaining now. Your systems handle most Bronze automatically. What frontier is calling?" → Conan compares: "Year 1 was survival. Year 2 was infrastructure. Year 3 was the first year where most Gold ventures were purely chosen." → Builder sets theme: "Year of Mentoring" → plans to explore social features
- Builder feels: "My life works for me. What do I want to do with that?"

### Anti-Examples

- **Annual reviews as mandatory ceremonies** — if the builder doesn't want an annual review, the sanctuary doesn't punish them. No guilt, no reminders.
- **Themes as commitments** — "Year of Health" is a direction, not a contract. If life changes direction mid-year, the theme adapts. No failure state.
- **Comparing to other builders** — annual reflection is always and only about this builder's own arc. No benchmarks, no percentiles, no "builders like you."
