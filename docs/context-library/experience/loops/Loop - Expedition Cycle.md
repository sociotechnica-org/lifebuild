# Loop - Expedition Cycle

## WHAT: The Cycle

The core engagement loop — the builder assesses their sanctuary, commits to a bounded expedition, executes daily work across multiple micro loops, and returns for a debrief. Duration is appetite-driven (3 days to 6 weeks). Each iteration is shaped work with explicit boundaries. This is where "I shaped a plan, ran it, and learned something" lives.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Timescale: days-weeks (appetite-driven)
- Rooms:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Assess phase (Jarvis presents sanctuary state)
  - [[Room - Sorting Room]] — Commit phase (priority confirmation)
  - [[Room - Drafting Room]] — Commit phase (expedition shaping with Marvin)
  - [[Room - Roster Room]] — Commit phase (attendant assignment)
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — Execute phase (daily work on the grid)
- Capabilities:
  - [[Capability - Purpose Assignment]] — stream classification during Commit
  - [[Capability - Three-Stream Filtering]] — priority view during Assess
- Systems:
  - [[System - Priority Queue Architecture]] — candidate sourcing during Commit
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — Assess and Return phases (state presentation, debrief)
  - [[Agent - Marvin]] — Commit phase (expedition shaping, task assignment)
  - [[Agent - Conan]] — Return phase (archives the expedition report)
- Contains:
  - [[Loop - Daily Check-In]] — micro loops compose the Execute phase
- Part of:
  - [[Loop - Seasonal Review]] — 3-5 expedition cycles per season
  - [[Journey - Sanctuary Progression]] — expeditions are the primary vehicle of progression

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — the expedition cycle IS the core process
- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — stewards participate in every phase
- Principle: [[Principle - Plans Are Hypotheses]] — expeditions have bounded appetite, not unbounded commitments
- Driver: The builder needs a rhythm of plan → execute → learn that compounds into life improvement. The expedition cycle creates that rhythm at a scale large enough for meaningful work, small enough for course correction.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No expedition framing exists. Builders create projects and work tasks, but there's no ASSESS→COMMIT→EXECUTE→RETURN cycle structure. No appetite declarations, no bounded expedition shaping, no debrief flow. The weekly planning concept in the Sorting Room is a partial precursor.

## HOW: The Cycle

### Phases

1. **Assess (The Sanctuary Walk)** — Survey the homestead state
2. **Commit (Expedition Shaping)** — Declare appetite, shape bounded work
3. **Execute (On the Land)** — Daily micro loops within expedition bounds
4. **Return (The Debrief)** — Reflect, archive, update the map

### Entry

Previous cycle concluded, or builder initiates a new expedition. The trigger can be: completing a prior expedition, a natural pause point, or the builder deciding "time to shape the next push."

### Completion

Three possible endings:

- **Completed** — the shaped work is done within appetite
- **Circuit-breaked** — appetite expired, work continues next cycle (not failure — expected)
- **Interrupted** — life redirected capacity outside the expedition

All three are legitimate endings. Conan archives the outcome. The map updates.

### Target Feeling

"I shaped a plan, ran it, and learned something."

### Examples

**Example 1:** Two-week Gold venture

- Trigger: Builder finishes previous expedition, enters Assess
- Cycle: Jarvis presents sanctuary state ("Health territory thriving, Career hex has been dormant") → builder declares 2-week appetite for Career Gold venture → Marvin shapes expedition: "Write and submit conference proposal" with 5 tasks, explicit boundaries ("not including travel planning") → builder assigns 2 Bronze research tasks to attendants → executes daily micro loops for 10 days → submits proposal → returns for debrief with Jarvis → Conan archives the expedition report
- Builder feels: "I did something meaningful and bounded. The career hex evolved."

**Example 2:** Circuit-breaker ending

- Trigger: Builder commits to 1-week Silver build: "Set up automated bill payment system"
- Cycle: Shapes 4 tasks with Marvin → executes for 4 days → unexpected family obligation consumes remaining appetite → expedition circuit-breaks with 2 tasks done, 2 remaining → Jarvis debriefs: "You got the core accounts automated. The remaining two can carry into next cycle." → Conan archives partial completion → remaining tasks carry forward
- Builder feels: "The appetite structure saved me from guilt. I did what I could."

### Anti-Examples

- **Expeditions without appetite bounds** — an open-ended "work on my career" isn't an expedition. Without declared appetite, there's no circuit breaker, no completion definition, no learning at the Return.
- **Treating circuit-breakers as failures** — the expedition cycle explicitly expects that reality will diverge from plan. Circuit-breaking IS the plan working correctly.
- **Skipping the Return phase** — jumping from Execute to the next Assess without debriefing loses the learning. Conan needs the data. The builder needs the reflection.
