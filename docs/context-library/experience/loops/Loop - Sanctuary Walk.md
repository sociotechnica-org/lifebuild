# Loop - Sanctuary Walk

## WHAT: The Cycle

A meta-level survey loop — the builder scans the entire hex grid, identifies what needs attention, tends overgrown areas, and returns to the sanctuary with an updated mental picture. This happens between expeditions or weekly during quieter periods. This is where "I know the state of my whole domain" lives.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Timescale: weekly (between expeditions)
- Rooms:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — hex grid scanning at Horizon View
- Capabilities:
  - [[Capability - Workspace Navigation]] — moving across the map at different zoom levels
- Systems:
  - [[System - Overgrowth]] — visual indicators of neglect
  - [[System - Clustering]] — territory organization reveals patterns
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — may accompany the walk, surfacing observations
- Contains: (none)
- Part of:
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — often triggers the Assess phase
  - [[Loop - Seasonal Review]] — seasonal reviews include a deep sanctuary walk

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] — the map as holistic life view
- Principle: [[Principle - Visibility Creates Agency]] — seeing the whole domain creates agency to act
- Driver: Builders need periodic zoomed-out awareness of their entire life landscape. The sanctuary walk prevents tunnel vision on active projects and surfaces neglected territories before they become crises.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No sanctuary walk mechanic exists. Builders can view the Life Map, but there's no guided scan flow, no overgrowth indicators on tiles, and no walk-style progression across the grid. The concept depends on mature hex grid with multiple territories and planted systems.

## HOW: The Cycle

### Phases

1. **Scan** — View the hex grid at Horizon View; take in the whole landscape
2. **Identify** — Notice what's overgrown, what's thriving, what's frontier
3. **Tend** — Visit territories that need attention; quick maintenance or flagging
4. **Return** — Return to the sanctuary with an updated picture of the whole domain

### Entry

Between expeditions (natural pause), or weekly as a ritual. Can also be triggered by Jarvis: "It's been a while since you walked the sanctuary."

### Completion

The builder has scanned their entire domain and addressed any immediate overgrowth. They know the state of their territories and have a mental model of what's thriving and what needs attention.

### Target Feeling

"I know the state of my whole domain."

### Examples

**Example 1:** Between-expedition survey

- Trigger: Builder finishes a Gold expedition, enters a cool-down period
- Cycle: Zooms out to Horizon View → notices Health territory hexes look muted (overgrowth indicators) → zooms into Health cluster → sees "Weekly exercise routine" system has 2 missed cycles → tends by rescheduling → notices Finance territory is thriving (all green) → returns to sanctuary center knowing the landscape
- Builder feels: "I caught the Health dip before it became a problem"

**Example 2:** Weekly ritual walk

- Trigger: Sunday evening ritual
- Cycle: Opens app → switches to Horizon View → slowly pans across all territories → everything looks maintained except one Creative hex that hasn't been touched in weeks → decides not to tend it now but makes a mental note → returns to sanctuary
- Builder feels: "My domain is mostly healthy. That Creative territory is a question for my next Jarvis session."

### Anti-Examples

- **The walk feeling like a chore list review** — the sanctuary walk is contemplative, not transactional. It's about seeing the whole landscape, not processing a queue of maintenance items.
- **Forcing the walk on a rigid schedule** — sanctuary walks are natural, not mandatory. The system may gently surface the option, but never nag or guilt.
- **Overgrowth presented as failure** — overgrowth is natural. Gardens grow whether you tend them or not. The walk reveals what needs attention without judgment.
