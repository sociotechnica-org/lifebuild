# Loop - Daily Check-In

## WHAT: The Cycle

The tightest engagement loop — the builder opens the app, surveys their active work on The Table, picks a task, executes it, and marks it complete. The hex tile updates immediately. One iteration takes minutes to hours. This is where "I'm making progress right now" lives.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Timescale: minutes-hours
- Rooms:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — hex grid where tiles update on completion
- Capabilities:
  - [[Capability - Workspace Navigation]] — moving between map and task
- Systems:
  - [[System - Bronze Stack]] — Bronze tasks surface here
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Marvin]] — task context when needed
- Contains: (none — this is the innermost loop)
- Part of:
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — daily check-ins compose the Execute phase
  - [[Journey - Sanctuary Progression]] — each check-in advances the builder's overall arc

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — atomic work execution with immediate feedback
- Principle: [[Principle - Visibility Creates Agency]] — tile updates make progress tangible
- Driver: The builder needs to feel forward motion within a single session. The micro loop creates a tight feedback cycle: do a thing, see it reflected on the map.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** Task completion exists (mark tasks done on project kanban boards). Hex tile visual updates on completion do not exist. The Table as a persistent overlay with Gold/Silver/Bronze positions does not exist — work is accessed through project detail pages. Progress rings and art evolution on tiles are not implemented.

## HOW: The Cycle

### Phases

1. **Arrive** — Builder opens the app, sees their sanctuary map
2. **Survey** — Check The Table for active Gold/Silver/Bronze positions
3. **Pick** — Select a task to work on
4. **Execute** — Do the work (outside the app or within it)
5. **Complete** — Mark the task done; hex tile updates visually

### Entry

Builder opens the app. No ritual or ceremony — just arriving at the sanctuary.

### Completion

A task is marked complete. The hex tile reflects the change: progress ring advances, art may evolve, system health indicators shift. The map looks different because of what the builder just did.

### Target Feeling

"I moved something forward today."

### Examples

**Example 1:** Morning routine check-in

- Trigger: Builder opens LifeBuild with coffee
- Cycle: Sees Bronze tasks on The Table → picks "Review weekly budget" (system-generated) → reviews in 15 minutes → marks done → Finance hex progress ring advances
- Builder feels: "Quick win, sanctuary is a little more tended"

**Example 2:** Deep work session

- Trigger: Builder has a 2-hour block for Gold work
- Cycle: Opens app → sees Gold venture task "Draft chapter outline" → works for 90 minutes → marks done → Creative Writing hex tile evolves from Sketch to Foundation stage
- Builder feels: "I built that. The map shows it."

### Anti-Examples

- **The check-in feels like a chore list review** — the micro loop should feel like tending your domain, not processing a queue. Visual feedback on the map transforms "check the box" into "see the change."
- **Tasks take so long they span multiple sessions without completion** — if a task regularly exceeds 2 hours, it should be decomposed. The micro loop needs completable units for the feedback cycle to work.
