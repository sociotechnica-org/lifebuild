# Loop - Seasonal Review

## WHAT: The Cycle

A macro engagement loop on a ~12-week cadence — four seasons per year, each with distinct character. The builder reviews what grew, rests, and plans the next season. Spring plants, Summer grows, Fall harvests, Winter rests. This is where "Look what grew this season" lives.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Timescale: ~12 weeks
- Rooms:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — seasonal review and planning with Jarvis
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — visual progression across the season
- Capabilities:
  - [[Capability - Purpose Assignment]] — seasonal theme setting
- Systems:
  - [[System - Priority Queue Architecture]] — seasonal candidate pool
- Agents:
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — facilitates seasonal review and planning ritual
  - [[Agent - Conan]] — surfaces seasonal comparison data
- Contains:
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — 3-5 expeditions compose a season
  - [[Loop - Sanctuary Walk]] — deep walk at season boundaries
- Part of:
  - [[Loop - Annual Reflection]] — four seasons compose a year
  - [[Journey - Sanctuary Progression]] — seasonal reviews mark major progression milestones

## WHY: Purpose

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] — seasonal rhythm prevents burnout and creates natural reflection points
- Principle: [[Principle - Plans Are Hypotheses]] — seasonal boundaries are natural points to reassess direction
- Driver: Builders need a rhythm longer than individual expeditions but shorter than a year. Seasons create natural cadence for planting, executing, harvesting, and resting — preventing the "always pushing" pattern that leads to capacity collapse.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Future
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-12):** No seasonal mechanic exists. Seasonal rhythm depends on mature expedition cycles, which themselves depend on the core loop being established. This is late-game infrastructure. ~12-week cadence is a starting assumption that needs testing.

## HOW: The Cycle

### Phases

1. **Review** — Harvest session with Jarvis: what grew, what didn't, what surprised
2. **Rest** — Reduced activity load. Fewer ventures. Lighter tending.
3. **Plan** — Planning session for the next season. What to plant, what to continue, what to prune.
4. **Declare** — Set seasonal direction and first expedition appetite

### Entry

~12-week boundary. Not calendar-rigid — the system suggests transition when the season feels complete.

### Completion

The builder has reviewed the previous season, rested, and declared direction for the next. The sanctuary visually reflects seasonal transition.

### Target Feeling

"Look what grew this season."

### Examples

**Example 1:** Fall → Winter transition

- Trigger: Builder reaches ~12-week mark; 3 expeditions completed
- Cycle: Jarvis opens harvest review → "This season you completed the financial restructuring Silver, planted 2 new systems, and your first aspirational Gold. Your drain score dropped from 5.8 to 4.3." → Conan surfaces comparison: "Last season was mostly Bronze tending; this one had real ventures." → Builder enters Winter mode: lighter tending load, reflective planning → declares Spring theme: "Year of Creative Projects"
- Builder feels: "The sanctuary grew measurably. I've earned this rest."

**Example 2:** Spring planting

- Trigger: Winter rest period concludes
- Cycle: Jarvis opens planning session → "You rested well. Three territories are stable. What do you want to cultivate this season?" → Builder identifies a new Gold venture and two Silver investments → shapes first expedition appetite → season begins
- Builder feels: "Fresh start energy. I know what I'm planting."

### Anti-Examples

- **Seasons as rigid calendar dates** — ~12 weeks is a starting point, not a rule. Seasons should feel natural, not arbitrary.
- **Skipping Winter** — rest is structurally built in, not optional. The game's seasonal rhythm makes Winter 30-60% lighter by design. Skipping rest leads to capacity collapse.
- **Seasonal reviews that feel like performance reviews** — the harvest is about learning and celebration, not evaluation. "What grew?" not "Did you hit your targets?"

### Seasonal Character

| Season | Character  | Optimal Activities                                               | Ritual                                 |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Spring | Planting   | New ventures conceived, Silver investments planned               | "What will you cultivate this season?" |
| Summer | Growing    | Execution peak, tending load highest, energy management critical | (none — just the work)                 |
| Fall   | Harvesting | Projects complete, systems mature, results visible               | "What bloomed? What didn't?"           |
| Winter | Resting    | Fewer ventures, reflection, pruning, planning                    | Fireside planning for Spring           |
