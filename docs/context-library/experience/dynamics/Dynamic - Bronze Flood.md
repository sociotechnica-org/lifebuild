# Dynamic - Bronze Flood

## WHAT: The Emergence

The builder plants too many systems too fast, and the aggregate Bronze maintenance load exceeds available capacity. Each individual system seemed manageable, but the total creates an unsustainable tending burden. The map shows many system tiles but the builder feels buried in maintenance rather than progressing.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Arises from:
  - [[Primitive - System]] — each system generates recurring Bronze tasks
  - [[System - Bronze Stack]] — Bronze tasks accumulate beyond manageable levels
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — maintenance drain exceeds capacity inflow
  - [[Loop - Daily Check-In]] — micro loop dominated by tending, no room for ventures
- Observed in:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — many system tiles, possible overgrowth appearing across multiple
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] — Bronze position overflowing
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Jarvis surfaces the pattern

## WHY: Significance

- Driver: Bronze Flood is the primary over-expansion signal. It indicates the builder is investing in infrastructure faster than capacity grows. If unchecked, the builder's sanctuary becomes a maintenance prison — the opposite of the intended progression toward sovereignty.

## WHEN: Trigger

The builder plants 3+ systems within a short period without first stabilizing maintenance for existing systems. Bronze maintenance cost per system is 0.5-3 hours/week; the flood becomes felt when aggregate maintenance exceeds ~70% of available capacity.

## HOW: Response

### System Response

Jarvis flags the maintenance load with curiosity, not alarm: "Your Bronze load has grown quite a bit in the last few weeks. How does the tending feel?" This invites the builder to notice the pattern without prescribing action. If the builder doesn't recognize it, Jarvis may follow up: "I think I may be missing something — my calculations have your maintenance at X hours/week. How are you experiencing it?"

Overgrowth may begin appearing on multiple system tiles simultaneously — a visual signal that maintenance is outpacing capacity.

### Builder Experience

The builder notices that daily check-ins are consumed entirely by Bronze tending. No time or energy for Gold ventures. The Table's Bronze position overflows. Expeditions stall because all capacity goes to maintenance.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Enthusiastic system builder

- Trigger: Growth-state builder discovers the compounding curve and plants 5 systems in 3 weeks
- Emerges from: Each system generates ~1.5 hrs/week Bronze tasks. Combined: ~7.5 hrs/week maintenance on top of existing load.
- Steward response: Jarvis notes: "You've planted five new systems this month. That's impressive infrastructure — but your Bronze load has nearly doubled. How are you managing?" Builder recognizes the flood and pauses new system investment until existing ones are stabilized.

**Example 2:** Gradual accumulation

- Trigger: Builder has been steadily planting systems for 6 months. Maintenance crept up unnoticed.
- Emerges from: 12 systems at 1 hr/week each = 12 hrs/week maintenance. Was manageable at 8 systems; now drowning.
- Steward response: Jarvis surfaces it during a sanctuary walk: "Your maintenance load has grown steadily. Some of these systems might benefit from optimization or delegation." Builder identifies 3 systems to delegate to attendants and 1 to decommission.

### Anti-Examples

- **Preventing the builder from planting systems** — Bronze Flood is a natural learning experience. The system should surface the dynamic, not block it. Builders learn capacity limits through experience.
- **Auto-decommissioning systems** — the stewards never decommission on their own. Marvin confirms: "Removing this system means these recurring tasks stop. Are you sure?" The builder decides.
- **Alarm or warning language** — "DANGER: Maintenance load critical!" violates the contemplative aesthetic. Jarvis uses curiosity, not urgency.
