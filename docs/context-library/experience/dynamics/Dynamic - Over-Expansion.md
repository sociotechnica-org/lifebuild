# Dynamic - Over-Expansion

## WHAT: The Emergence

The builder's territorial ambition exceeds their capacity. They claim new hexes, start new projects, and expand into frontier areas faster than their infrastructure can support. The map grows impressively but the builder can't sustain what they've claimed. Overgrowth appears across multiple territories simultaneously.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Arises from:
  - [[Structure - Hex Grid]] — hex placement outpacing capacity
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — sinks exceed faucets
  - [[System - Overgrowth]] — multiple territories showing neglect signs
  - [[Primitive - Project]] — too many active projects
- Observed in:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — wide territory with visible overgrowth
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Jarvis models the math
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] — WIP limits strained

## WHY: Significance

- Driver: Over-Expansion is the spatial manifestation of overcommitment. The builder's ambition is admirable, but the sanctuary can only sustain what the builder can tend. Over-Expansion teaches a crucial lesson: growth without maintenance is just claiming territory you can't hold.

## WHEN: Trigger

Multiple territories showing overgrowth simultaneously. New hexes placed but existing ones neglected. Bronze maintenance exceeding 70% of capacity. The builder starts new projects before completing existing ones.

## HOW: Response

### System Response

Overgrowth is visible on the map — muted colors, dormancy signs across multiple hexes. This is the primary signal. The map shows overextension before it becomes crisis.

Jarvis models the math with curiosity, not authority: "I might be reading this wrong, but it looks like your maintenance load has grown to about X hours/week. Your available capacity is around Y. How are you thinking about that gap?" The framing is honest data, not prescription.

### Builder Experience

The builder feels stretched thin. Every territory needs attention. New ventures can't get traction because existing ones demand maintenance. The map, which should feel like accomplishment, starts to feel like obligation.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Frontier excitement

- Trigger: Builder who reached The Shift gets excited about capacity surplus and claims 5 new frontier hexes in one season
- Emerges from: Genuine surplus exists but is consumed entirely by new territory. Net position is back to pre-Shift levels.
- Steward response: Jarvis: "You've expanded impressively this season. I notice some of your older territories are showing signs of needing attention. How do you want to balance growth with maintenance?" Builder recognizes: The Shift doesn't mean infinite capacity.

**Example 2:** Life-event expansion

- Trigger: Builder starts a new job, has a baby, and moves house in the same quarter. Three new major life territories all at once.
- Emerges from: External life events, not builder choice. Capacity redirected to new demands.
- Steward response: Jarvis acknowledges the reality: "That's a lot of new territory at once. Some of your existing systems might need to go dormant while you handle this. Which territories are essential right now?" Builder pauses some systems, focuses capacity.

### Anti-Examples

- **Preventing territory expansion** — Over-Expansion is a learning experience. The system shows the consequences via the map, not by blocking hex placement.
- **Auto-pausing systems** — stewards never take action without builder approval. They surface the dynamic and suggest options. The builder decides what to pause, defer, or decommission.
- **Catastrophic consequences for overextension** — overgrowth is gentle and recoverable. Over-expanded builders need a path back, not punishment.
