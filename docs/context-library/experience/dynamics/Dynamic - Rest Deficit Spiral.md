# Dynamic - Rest Deficit Spiral

## WHAT: The Emergence

The builder skips rest repeatedly — Restore activities get deprioritized in favor of Gold ventures and Bronze tending. Capacity declines over cycles, making everything harder, which makes the builder skip more rest to keep up, accelerating the decline. This is the death spiral that real-world burnout follows.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Arises from:
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — Restore activities skipped, personal investment zero
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — rest not integrated into cycle energy budget
  - [[Loop - Seasonal Review]] — Winter rest period skipped or minimized
- Observed in:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Jarvis notices declining capacity trend
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — hex tiles may show general quality decline as builder's energy drops

## WHY: Significance

- Driver: Rest Deficit Spiral is the dynamic that validates LifeBuild's core moral position: rest isn't reward, it's fuel. Systems that say "drain your bucket to earn the right to fill it" are morally injurious. LifeBuild says: rest first, build capacity, then direct it toward what matters. When a builder enters the spiral, the sanctuary's design must respond with the right framing.

## WHEN: Trigger

Declining capacity trend across 2+ expedition cycles. Builder's felt experience ratings (Red/Gray/Blue) trend toward Red. Restore activities absent from recent work patterns. The builder is pushing harder but accomplishing less.

## HOW: Response

### System Response

Jarvis frames rest as investment, not reward: "Your drain scores have been climbing. Rest isn't what you earn after doing enough — it's what makes everything else possible. How are you taking care of yourself?" This reframes the narrative from "you haven't earned rest yet" to "rest is the missing investment."

The seasonal rhythm provides a structural backstop: Winter is 30-60% lighter by design. Even builders in the spiral benefit from the seasonal reduction in expected activity.

### Builder Experience

The builder feels increasingly exhausted and frustrated. Things that used to feel manageable now feel draining. Gold ventures lose their appeal. Bronze tending feels oppressive. The builder may not connect these symptoms to rest deficit — they may think they need to work harder, not rest more.

### Examples

**Example 1:** High-achieving builder ignoring rest

- Trigger: Optimization Engineer builder has been pushing hard for 3 months. No Blue time. All Gold and Bronze.
- Emerges from: The builder's self-image is "I'm productive." Rest feels like weakness. They optimize everything except their own recovery.
- Steward response: Jarvis notices the trend: "Your recent ventures have been taking longer than your appetite declared. Your drain scores are climbing. I have a theory — but I'm curious what you think is happening." If the builder doesn't connect rest to the pattern, Jarvis offers: "What if the missing input isn't more effort but more recovery?"

**Example 2:** Seasonal correction

- Trigger: Builder has been in low-grade spiral for a full season. Winter arrives.
- Emerges from: Gradual accumulation of rest deficit over Summer and Fall.
- Steward response: Jarvis opens Winter planning: "This is the season for lighter work. Your capacity data suggests you really need it — your drain has been climbing for 8 weeks." The structural lightness of Winter provides recovery even if the builder doesn't explicitly "rest."

### Anti-Examples

- **Forcing rest mechanically** — "You cannot start a new Gold venture until you log 2 hours of Blue time" is coercive, not caring. Rest must be chosen, not gated.
- **Guilt language about not resting** — "You haven't rested in 3 weeks!" creates anxiety about rest, which is worse than no rest.
- **Treating the spiral as failure** — the builder is not failing. Modern life genuinely pressures people to skip rest. The system recognizes the pattern and offers an alternative frame, not a judgment.
