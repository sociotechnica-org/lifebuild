# Dynamic - The Plateau

## WHAT: The Emergence

The sanctuary is mature, systems are running, maintenance is handled — but the builder has disengaged. Gold ventures have stopped. No new frontier is being explored. The builder opens the app, tends a few things, and leaves. The sanctuary is self-sustaining but the builder is no longer growing.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Arises from:
  - [[Journey - Sanctuary Progression]] — Phase 3 reached but stagnating
  - [[Loop - Expedition Cycle]] — no new expeditions initiated
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — surplus exists but is not directed
- Observed in:
  - [[Room - Council Chamber]] — Jarvis notices the pattern
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — map stable but no frontier activity
  - [[Overlay - The Table]] — Gold position consistently empty

## WHY: Significance

- Driver: The Plateau is the endgame risk. A sanctuary that runs perfectly but produces no growth is a comfortable prison. The builder has achieved sovereignty — the question becomes: sovereignty for what? The Plateau is where LifeBuild's deeper philosophical bet is tested: does the sanctuary exist to manage life, or to enable a life worth managing?

## WHEN: Trigger

Sustained period (multiple expedition cycles) with no Gold ventures initiated. Builder engagement reduced to maintenance-only. No frontier exploration. Capacity surplus consistently unused.

## HOW: Response

### System Response

Jarvis invites frontier exploration with gentle curiosity: "Your sanctuary is running beautifully. When did you last venture out for something that excited you?" This is an invitation, not a nudge. If the builder is content with maintenance mode, that's a valid choice. But Jarvis names the pattern so the builder can choose consciously.

The frontier remains visible on the map — grayed-out hexes at the edges, representing unexplored potential. Their presence is a quiet reminder that growth is always available.

### Builder Experience

The builder may feel satisfaction (the sanctuary works) mixed with restlessness (is this all there is?). Or they may feel content and need no prodding. The Plateau is only a problem if the builder is disengaged rather than deliberately resting.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Post-Shift contentment

- Trigger: Builder reached Directed Living 3 months ago. Since then: only Bronze maintenance, no Gold.
- Emerges from: The relief of The Shift was so welcome that the builder is resting in the surplus without directing it.
- Steward response: Jarvis: "You've built something remarkable here. I'm curious — is this a rest season, or are you looking for what comes next?" If rest: "Enjoy it. The frontier will be there when you're ready." If restless: "What's the most interesting grayed-out territory on your map right now?"

**Example 2:** Life-stage plateau

- Trigger: Builder's life circumstances have stabilized. New baby is 1 year old. Routines are set. Not much new frontier feels relevant.
- Emerges from: The builder's actual life is in a stable phase. The Plateau reflects reality, not disengagement.
- Steward response: Jarvis recognizes the life stage: "Sometimes the sanctuary holds steady while life unfolds. Is this a season for consolidation?" No pressure to grow. Consolidation is valid.

### Anti-Examples

- **Generating artificial urgency** — "You haven't started a Gold venture in 6 weeks! Your sanctuary needs growth!" violates the contemplative aesthetic. The Plateau is named, not alarmed about.
- **Auto-suggesting Gold ventures** — Marvin populating the Priority Queue with AI-generated suggestions feels pushy and violates builder sovereignty. The builder decides when to venture.
- **Treating The Plateau as failure** — a well-running sanctuary that the builder tends contentedly is a success state, not a problem. The Plateau is only concerning if the builder feels stuck, not if they feel settled.
