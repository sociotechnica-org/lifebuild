# Dynamic - External Disruption

## WHAT: The Emergence

Life redirects all capacity outside the sanctuary. A family emergency, job loss, health crisis, or other external event consumes the builder's bandwidth entirely. The sanctuary goes untended — not by choice, but by necessity. The defining question: what happens when the builder returns?

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Arises from:
  - External life events (outside the system)
  - [[System - Capacity Economy]] — capacity redirected outside the sanctuary
- Observed in:
  - [[Zone - Life Map]] — overgrowth appearing across multiple territories
  - [[System - Overgrowth]] — gradual dormancy indicators
  - [[Loop - Daily Check-In]] — loop stops entirely

## WHY: Significance

- Driver: External Disruption is the ultimate test of the sanctuary's core promise: **the sanctuary holds**. If the builder returns to punishment, catastrophic decay, or guilt messaging, the sanctuary is no better than any other app that makes absence feel worse than it should. If the builder returns to a place that held their work, shows gentle overgrowth, and welcomes them back — that IS the product working.

## WHEN: Trigger

Builder stops engaging for 1+ weeks due to external life circumstances. The trigger is always outside the system's control and always valid.

## HOW: Response

### System Response

The sanctuary holds. Specifically:
- **Short absence (< 1 week):** Minimal change. Business as usual when the builder returns.
- **Medium absence (1-4 weeks):** Some overgrowth visible. Gradual muted colors on neglected system hexes. Jarvis: "Welcome back. A few things need tending — want to walk the sanctuary?"
- **Long absence (1+ months):** Significant overgrowth. Multiple territories showing dormancy. Jarvis: "The sanctuary held while you were away. Where would you like to start?" Builder chooses re-entry pace.

Recovery is always proportional to neglect. A week away = trivial catch-up. A month = a focused tending cycle. Nothing requires rebuilding from scratch.

### Builder Experience

The builder returns to a place that is recognizable, intact, and welcoming. Some things need attention, but nothing is destroyed. The stewards are warm. There is no judgment. The builder chooses their own re-entry pace.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Two-week family emergency

- Trigger: Family health crisis takes the builder offline for 2 weeks
- Emerges from: All capacity redirected to the real-world situation
- Steward response: Builder returns. Map shows some muted hexes. Jarvis: "Welcome back. I hope things are settling. A few systems need attention, but nothing is broken. Want to take a walk?" Builder does a gentle sanctuary walk, handles 3 quick Bronze tasks, feels grounded.

**Example 2:** Three-month burnout absence

- Trigger: Builder experienced burnout, stopped engaging with everything including LifeBuild
- Emerges from: Capacity collapse — not just external disruption but internal depletion
- Steward response: Builder returns after 3 months. Significant overgrowth across the map. Jarvis: "The sanctuary held while you were away. Where would you like to start?" No mention of duration. No "it's been 3 months." Just warmth. Builder starts with one small Bronze task and gradually re-engages.

### Anti-Examples

- **Push notifications about neglect** — "You haven't visited in 12 days! Your systems need you!" is the single worst thing the sanctuary could do. The builder is dealing with real life. The sanctuary waits.
- **Score penalties or streak-breaking** — any mechanism that makes absence feel worse than it already does is morally wrong. LifeBuild has no streaks, no "days since last login," no decay penalties.
- **Catastrophic state on return** — if the builder returns to find systems destroyed, data lost, or the map fundamentally degraded, the sanctuary broke its promise. Overgrowth is always gentle and always recoverable.
- **"Welcome back!" with implicit judgment** — "We missed you! It's been 47 days!" is guilt dressed as warmth. Jarvis acknowledges the return without measuring the absence.
