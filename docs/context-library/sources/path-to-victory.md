## What "Victory" Looks Like

LifeBuild wins when it becomes **the place where thoughtful people manage their lives** — not as a task list or calendar, but as a living sanctuary they actively cultivate.

**Concrete victory conditions:**

1. **Product-Market Fit Signal:** Users who complete onboarding return 3+ times per week for 8+ weeks
2. **Word of Mouth:** >50% of new users come from referrals, not marketing
3. **Outcome Proof:** Users report measurably reduced overwhelm and increased intentionality (qualitative + NPS)
4. **Revenue Viability:** Sustainable unit economics on a subscription model
5. **Moat Establishment:** Full context (builder context) becomes deep enough that switching costs are real

## The Path

### Phase 0: Foundation (Current → Release 1)
**Goal:** Prove the campfire works — first-time users feel the magic

- [ ] Ship Release 1: The Campfire
- [ ] Validate onboarding flow (campfire → first project → first hex)
- [ ] Jarvis can hold a useful conversation about your life
- [ ] Spatial map feels meaningful, not gimmicky
- [ ] 10 alpha users complete onboarding and return

**Key bet:** The "sanctuary building" metaphor resonates emotionally, not just functionally

### Phase 1: Retention (Release 2-3)
**Goal:** Users come back — the sanctuary becomes part of their routine

- [ ] Return experience works (second visit feels natural)
- [ ] Builder context accumulates and becomes useful
- [ ] Jarvis gets noticeably better as it learns you
- [ ] Projects complete and new ones emerge organically
- [ ] Weekly active users stabilize (not just novelty)

**Key bet:** Context compounds — Jarvis knowing your patterns is genuinely valuable

### Phase 2: Expansion (Release 4-6)
**Goal:** The sanctuary grows — users invest in building out their space

- [ ] Multiple attendants (agents) doing real work
- [ ] Integrations bring external data into the sanctuary
- [ ] Capacity system (Maintain/Invest/Spend) provides real guidance
- [ ] Users feel the "map as scoreboard" — their life visible

**Key bet:** Agents doing work for you (not just advising) is a step change in value

### Phase 3: Network (Release 7-9)
**Goal:** LifeBuild becomes a community, not just a tool

- [ ] Shared patterns/templates across users (anonymized)
- [ ] Agent training compounds across the user base
- [ ] Brand becomes a statement of values ("I'm a LifeBuilder")
- [ ] Network effects make the product better for everyone

**Key bet:** Network effects in life management are possible and valuable

### Phase 4: Dominance
**Goal:** LifeBuild is the default answer to "how do I manage my life?"

- [ ] Category definition (we created "sanctuary building")
- [ ] Trusted brand (people recommend us without hesitation)
- [ ] Full context moat (can't export your accumulated understanding)
- [ ] Outcome-based pricing viable (pay for results, not seats)

## Critical Path Items (Now)

The immediate blockers between here and Phase 0 completion:

1. **Ship The Campfire** — Release 1 must land
2. **Validate emotional resonance** — does the metaphor work?
3. **Jarvis quality bar** — is the steward conversation good enough?
4. **Return experience** — do people come back?

## What Could Kill Us

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Metaphor doesn't resonate | Medium | Fatal | Test with real users fast, be willing to pivot framing |
| Jarvis isn't good enough | Medium | High | Invest in prompt craft, consider fine-tuning |
| Context becomes portable | Low (for now) | High | Make context active (does things), not just passive (stores things) |
| Bigger player copies us | Medium | Medium | Move fast, build brand, establish network effects |
| Users don't return | High | Fatal | Obsess over return experience, build habits |
