# The Power of the Portal

**Snapshot date:** 2026-02-26
**Format:** Two-host conversational podcast script (~25 minutes)
**Context:** Strategic design document applying video game first-experience design principles to LifeBuild onboarding. Written after the conversation-first campfire approach was tested and found insufficient.

## Provenance Index

This source informed the following library changes:

### New Cards Created

- Principle - Action Before Explanation
- Principle - Compression and Release
- Principle - The WOW Chain

### Cards Updated (Surgery)

- Component - Campfire (causality inversion: conversation-first → compression phase)
- Journey - Builder Onboarding (MI phases → wow chain choreography)
- Standard - Onboarding Sequence (3-day progressive disclosure → 5-minute wow chain + deepening)
- System - Onboarding (state machine reoriented around wow chain)
- Principle - Agreement Over Expectation (scoped to long-term relationships, not first contact)
- Principle - First 72 Hours (first 5 minutes become the critical path)
- Agent - Jarvis (onboarding role simplified)
- Agent - Marvin (entrance as wow beat)
- Release - The Campfire (reframed around portal design)

## Key Concepts

### 1. Action Before Explanation (Segment 1)

Comprehension follows action, never the other way around. The best tutorials are invisible — the player never knows they're in one. Teach by letting people DO things, not by TELLING them things. Only teach what they need in the moment they need it.

Examples: Super Mario Bros (first screen), Civilization (first turn), Stardew Valley (Day 1).

### 2. Compression and Release — The Portal (Segment 2)

Three ingredients: compression (contained, intimate, focused space), crossing (distinct moment of transition), release (surprising expansion). The portal IS the onboarding — emotional impact and functional teaching are the same thing.

Derived from Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural compression-release pattern. Examples: Myst (library → island), Breath of the Wild (cave → Hyrule), forest path → hidden lake.

### 3. The WOW Chain (Segment 3)

After a portal reveal, a sequence of varied surprises prevents deflation. Each wow is a different KIND of surprise (mechanical, visceral, relational, personal, scalar). Spacing: new wow before the last one fades. The hook: the moment the player's input becomes part of the world.

Examples: God of War (axe recall → combat → companion → boss), Animal Crossing (island → furniture tree → pun fish → name the island).

### 4. Application to LifeBuild (Segment 4)

The conversation-first campfire approach failed because it explained the world before the builder could see it. The fix: compression (intimate space with Jarvis, one question), release (map reveal), wow chain (words become hex → Marvin appears → builder places hex → attendant starts working). Five minutes from app open to "I have a project on a map, a team working on it, and something is already happening."

### 5. Open Design Question

"How does a conversation become a map piece?" — the words-to-world transition is the product's entire pitch in one moment. The design question is visual/emotional, not technical.
