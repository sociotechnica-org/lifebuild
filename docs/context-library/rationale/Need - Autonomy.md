# Need - Autonomy

## WHAT: Definition

The psychological need to feel in control of one's own actions and decisions — to be the origin of one's behavior rather than feeling controlled by external forces.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Foundation: [[Self-Determination Theory]] — one of three innate psychological needs
- Sibling needs: [[Need - Competence]], [[Need - Relatedness]]
- Primary bet advancing this: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]]
- Supporting bet: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] (plans as hypotheses, not contracts)

## WHY: Significance

When autonomy is satisfied, people experience enhanced motivation, creativity, and wellbeing. When thwarted — through controlling environments, external pressure, or lack of choice — people experience diminished functioning, resistance, and disengagement.

In LifeBuild, autonomy manifests as directors seeing and controlling their work. The spatial Life Map creates comprehension that enables agency. Directors place their own projects, choose their own classifications, adapt their own plans. The system informs and recommends but never controls.

The opposite of autonomy support is controlling behavior: surveillance, deadlines as threats, forced choices, hiding information, overriding decisions. LifeBuild's design principles protect against these patterns.

## HOW: Application

When evaluating any feature or agent behavior, ask: "Does this increase or decrease the director's sense of control over their own life?"

**Signs of autonomy support:**

- Director makes the decision
- Information is visible, not hidden
- Choices are framed as options, not requirements
- Plans can be changed without guilt
- The system explains its recommendations

**Signs of autonomy threat:**

- System makes decisions for director
- Information hidden until "needed"
- Guilt for changing plans
- Mandatory sequences or gates
- Opaque recommendations

## Implementing Principles

- [[Principle - Visibility Creates Agency]] — can't control what you can't see
- [[Principle - Plans Are Hypotheses]] — adaptation is leadership, not failure
- [[Principle - Empty Slots Strategic]] — permission to choose restraint
- [[Principle - Familiarity Over Function]] — director's classification is final
