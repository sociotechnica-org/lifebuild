# Need - Relatedness

## WHAT: Definition

The psychological need to feel connected to others — to experience caring relationships, to belong, to matter to others and have others matter to you.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Foundation: [[Self-Determination Theory]] — one of three innate psychological needs
- Sibling needs: [[Need - Autonomy]], [[Need - Competence]]
- Primary bet advancing this: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]]
- Supporting bet: [[Strategy - Superior Process]] (coordination enables collaboration)

## WHY: Significance

When relatedness is satisfied, people experience security, willingness to explore, and prosocial behavior. When thwarted — through isolation, rejection, or purely transactional interactions — people experience loneliness, defensiveness, and withdrawal.

In LifeBuild, relatedness manifests as directors working with a team of AI agents who function as colleagues, not tools. Each agent has a distinct role and personality. Relationships develop over time as agents learn the director's patterns and preferences. The director isn't alone in managing their life — they have support.

This is a deliberate design choice. Most productivity tools are solitary experiences — you and your list. LifeBuild creates the experience of having a staff, even for individuals who could never afford human assistance.

The opposite of relatedness support is cold instrumentality: purely transactional interactions, no continuity, no care for the person. LifeBuild's design principles protect against these patterns.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Foundation
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** Relatedness is partially served. Three agents active with distinct personalities (Cameron, Marvin, Mesa). Eight category advisors have personalities defined but are not user-accessible. Agent conversations feel teammate-like, not tool-like. But no continuity between sessions, no knowledge accumulation, no Charter — agents don't "remember" the director yet.

## HOW: Application

When evaluating any feature or agent behavior, ask: "Does this feel like working with a colleague, or using a tool?"

**Signs of relatedness support:**

- Agents have consistent personalities
- Relationship develops over time
- Agents remember and reference past work
- Agents show appropriate care for director wellbeing
- Director feels supported, not alone

**Signs of relatedness threat:**

- Generic, interchangeable responses
- No continuity between sessions
- Purely transactional interactions
- Director feels isolated with their work
- Agents feel like tools, not teammates

## Implementing Principles

- [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — learn like a colleague, not a bureaucrat
- [[Principle - Guide When Helpful]] — present when needed, not intrusive
- [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] — relationship begins with real help
