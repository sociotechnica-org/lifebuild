# Principle - The WOW Chain

## WHAT: The Principle

After a reveal, a sequence of varied surprises prevents deflation. Each wow is a different KIND of surprise, spaced so a new wow lands before the last fades. Each wow also teaches the builder something about the product -- but the builder never feels taught. The hook: the moment the builder's input becomes part of the world.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Advances: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] -- wow beats introduce teammates through action, not introduction
- Related: [[Principle - Action Before Explanation]] -- each wow is also a lesson disguised as a surprise
- Related: [[Principle - Compression and Release]] -- the portal is beat #0 that opens the chain
- Related: [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] -- wow beats front-load the first session within the 72-hour window
- Governs: [[Journey - Builder Onboarding]] -- wow beat choreography
- Governs: [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] -- sequencing constraints for surprise beats

## WHY: Belief

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] -- teammates are introduced through their actions, which are surprises in themselves
- Driver: After a huge reveal, there's a risk of deflation -- the blank canvas problem. If nothing follows the portal, the feeling fades fast. The wow chain keeps attention alive. God of War follows the axe recall with combat, then a companion, then a boss -- each a different kind of surprise. Animal Crossing follows the island reveal with a furniture tree, then a pun fish, then naming the island. Without the chain, the reveal is a peak followed by a cliff.

## WHEN: Timeline

New to the library (2026-02-26). Source: Power of the Portal podcast script. The illustrative wow chain for LifeBuild (portal, hex materializes, Marvin appears, builder places hex, attendant starts) is a starting point for experimentation, not a tested spec.

## HOW: Application

### Wow Variety Types

From game design, five types of surprise that feel different:

- **Mechanical** -- "I can DO this" (a new interaction is possible)
- **Visceral** -- "this FEELS powerful" (sensory or emotional impact)
- **Relational** -- "I'm not alone" (a character or teammate appears)
- **Personal** -- "this is MINE" (the player's input becomes part of the world)
- **Scalar** -- "things get BIG" (scope expands beyond expectation)

### Spacing Rule

New wow before the last one fades. In games, roughly 60-90 seconds between beats. In LifeBuild onboarding, the first 5 minutes should contain 4-5 beats.

### The Hook

The moment the builder's input becomes part of the world. Animal Crossing: naming the island. LifeBuild: words becoming a hex on the map. This is the personal wow -- and it's the one that creates ownership.

### Illustrative LifeBuild WOW Chain

Starting point for experimentation, not canonical:

- **Beat #1 (spatial):** Map reveals after portal. "Oh -- there's a world here."
- **Beat #2 (personal):** Builder's words materialize as a hex. "My words are becoming real."
- **Beat #3 (relational):** Marvin appears, already breaking down the problem. "I have a team."
- **Beat #4 (agency):** Builder places the hex on the map. "This is mine. I chose where it goes."
- **Beat #5 (scalar):** An attendant picks up a task. "Something is already happening."

### What Following This Looks Like

- Each wow is a different kind of surprise. Each teaches something. The builder never feels taught.
- After the portal, the builder experiences 4-5 distinct surprise moments within the first 5 minutes -- spatial, personal, relational, agency, scalar.
- The builder's words becoming a hex on the map (the hook) creates ownership. This is not a form submission; it's creation.

### What Violating This Looks Like

- All wows being the same type -- four cool features in a row produces diminishing impact.
- Long gaps where nothing new happens -- deflation sets in and the blank canvas problem takes over.
- Wows that require explanation before they land -- violates Action Before Explanation. If you have to explain the surprise, it's not surprising.
- The builder finishing the first session without having been surprised at least 3 times.

### Tensions

- With simplicity -- 4-5 beats in 5 minutes could feel overwhelming. Resolution: each beat is brief (seconds, not minutes) and builds on the last. The variety prevents overload because each engages a different faculty.
- With reliability -- surprises are hard to engineer consistently. Resolution: the wow chain is a design target, not a guarantee. Prototype and test.

### Test

After the first 5 minutes, can the builder name 3 things that surprised them? If yes, the chain is working.
