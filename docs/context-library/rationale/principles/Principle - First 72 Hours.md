# Principle - First 72 Hours

## WHAT: The Principle

The first 72 hours define the relationship. A new builder's initial experience with LifeBuild must establish the spatial metaphor, introduce the agent team, capture initial context, and create momentum -- all without overwhelming. Get this right and builders understand what LifeBuild is; get it wrong and they never return.

The first five minutes are the critical path. The portal, the wow chain, and the first action must land before any deeper engagement. Days 2 and 3 deepen what was established in the first session, not reveal new worlds.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Type: Design Principle
- Advances: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — first impressions of the team matter
- Related: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — progressive capture, not forms
- Related: [[Principle - Action Before Explanation]] -- first action within 15 seconds
- Related: [[Principle - Compression and Release]] -- the portal opens the 72-hour window
- Related: [[Principle - The WOW Chain]] -- wow beats front-load the first session
- Related: [[Principle - Compound Capability]] -- tension resolved through sequencing
- Governs: [[System - Onboarding]] — the mechanism serving this principle
- Governs: [[Component - Campfire]] — the warm origin and first-contact point
- Creates: [[Artifact - The Charter]] — initial version during onboarding
- Implemented by: [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] — makes day-by-day sequence testable

## WHY: Belief

- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — first impressions of the team matter
- Driver: New users abandon tools that feel overwhelming or empty. The first 72 hours must create momentum and understanding simultaneously.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** No onboarding flow exists. No Campfire component, no Day 1/2/3 sequence, no progressive introduction to agents. New users land on the Life Map with no guided entry point. The Onboarding system this principle governs is not implemented.

**Design refinement (2026-02-26):** Portal-first philosophy adopted. The first five minutes are the critical path -- portal crossing, wow chain, first hex placement. Days 2-3 become deepening, not revealing. Source: Power of the Portal.

## HOW: Application

**Day 1 Goals: The Portal + First Session**

- Portal crossing (Campfire to Map reveal)
- Wow chain: words become hex, Marvin appears, builder places hex
- First project shaped and placed on the map
- Builder has a project, a team, and something happening -- within the first session

**Day 2 Goals: Meet the Team**

- Jarvis introduction (Council Chamber)
- Initial Charter conversation (values, current focus)
- Second project with Marvin (Drafting Room)
- Sense of "I have help"

**Day 3 Goals: Establish Rhythm**

- First Sorting Room visit (Marvin)
- Work at Hand selection (even minimal)
- The Table populated
- Sense of "I know what to do each week"

**Governing constraints:**

- The first 5 minutes deliver the complete mental model through action: this is spatial, I have a team, my words become real. Days 2 and 3 deepen this foundation.
- Progressive disclosure -- features unlock as relevant
- Never rush or overwhelm
- Celebrate small wins
- "You can explore more later"
- Warm, patient, encouraging tone throughout

**What this principle governs:**

- Agent prompt design for onboarding conversations
- Feature unlock sequencing
- Default project templates for new builders
- Campfire design and first-contact experience

### What Following This Looks Like

- A new builder arrives, Jarvis greets them warmly at the Campfire, and within 15 minutes they've placed their first project on the hex grid — they leave Day 1 with a tangible artifact and the spatial metaphor clicked.
- On Day 2, Jarvis introduces himself in the Council Chamber with a short, warm conversation about the builder's current focus. The builder creates a second project with Marvin and feels "I have a team helping me" — not "I have a tool to learn."
- By end of Day 3, the builder has visited the Sorting Room, selected their first Work at Hand, and sees The Table populated. The rhythm is established without any feature having been forced or rushed.

### What Violating This Looks Like

- **Overwhelming on Day 1 with full feature tour** — The first day is about one thing: spatial metaphor + first project + sense of "I made something." Showing The Table, the Sorting Room, and agent capabilities on Day 1 creates cognitive overload and abandonment.
- **Requiring extensive profile completion before first action** — A new builder should create their first project within minutes. Every field between arrival and that first "I made something" moment is friction that kills momentum.
- **Empty-feeling onboarding with no quick win** — If Day 1 ends without the builder having created something tangible, the tool feels hollow. The first project (low stakes, quick win) establishes that LifeBuild produces, not just organizes.
- **Treating Day 1 as orientation rather than action** — If the builder leaves the first 5 minutes without having acted on the map, the 72-hour clock is already losing.

### Tensions

- With [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — compound features need time to reveal value; resolution is sequencing: quick wins that also establish compound foundations
- With [[Principle - Empty Slots Strategic]] — first 72 hours optimize for wins, not rest; resolution is sequencing (quick wins first, strategic rest later)
- With feature depth — showing enough to orient without overwhelming; resolution is progressive guidance, not progressive disclosure

### Test

Does this design create momentum and understanding in the first 72 hours without overwhelming the new builder?
