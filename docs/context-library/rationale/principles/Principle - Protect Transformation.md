# Principle - Protect Transformation

## WHAT: The Principle

A single ranked priority list lets urgent maintenance perpetually displace important transformation — three streams provide structural protection.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Type: Design Principle
- Serves: [[Need - Competence]] — structural protection enables completion
- Advances: [[Strategy - Superior Process]]
- Governs: [[Capability - Three-Stream Filtering]], [[Overlay - The Table]], [[System - Bronze Operations]], [[Room - Sorting Room]], [[System - Weekly Priority]]
- Table positions: [[Component - Gold Position]], [[Component - Silver Position]], [[Component - Bronze Position]]
- Related: [[Principle - Empty Slots Strategic]] — protection includes permission to rest

## WHY: Belief

The neurological case is decisive: the brain's threat-detection system (amygdala-driven) responds to urgent/concrete stimuli faster than the prefrontal cortex can evaluate important/abstract priorities. This isn't a character flaw — it's architecture. A single ranked list exploits this asymmetry by putting urgent and important items in direct competition, where urgency has a neurological head start.

Three streams aren't three lists — they're three separate competitions. Gold items compete only with other Gold items (on importance). Bronze items compete only with other Bronze items (on urgency). The streams prevent cross-type competition entirely.

Gold and Silver have reserved slots that Bronze cannot invade. Life sometimes demands an all-Bronze response (a major storm, a health crisis), and the system supports those periods without judgment — but the default protects transformation.

We're not saying maintenance doesn't matter. Bronze is essential. The claim is that maintenance doesn't need structural protection — it has urgency on its side already. Transformation needs protection because it lacks urgency's neurological advantage.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP
**Implementation status:** Implemented
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** The Table enforces 1 Gold + 1 Silver max with separate Bronze position. Three-stream filtering works. Gold/Silver/Bronze are structurally separate competitions. The core protection mechanism is fully operational.

## HOW: Application

The Table enforces 1 Gold + 1 Silver maximum. Bronze has its own position that cannot expand into the transformation slots. When designing any prioritization interface, ensure Bronze cannot crowd out Gold/Silver through sheer volume.

### What Following This Looks Like
- A director's Bronze list has 12 urgent items this week, but The Table still shows their Gold project (marathon training) in its reserved slot. The urgent items compete among themselves for Bronze position — they never displace the transformation work.
- During a heavy maintenance week, Cameron surfaces the Gold project in the weekly check-in: "Your Gold is still reserved — even 30 minutes on marathon training this week keeps the momentum." The structural protection ensures transformation stays visible even when urgency dominates attention.
- A director opens The Table and sees three distinct areas: Gold at top, Silver in the middle, Bronze below. The visual separation reinforces that these are different competitions — "pay electric bill" and "train for marathon" never appear in the same ranked list.

### What Violating This Looks Like
- **A single ranked priority list mixing all streams** — This is the core failure the principle prevents. Urgency has a neurological head start (amygdala responds faster than prefrontal cortex). A combined list lets "pay electric bill" perpetually displace "train for marathon" because the brain processes urgency before importance.
- **Allowing Bronze volume to crowd Gold/Silver slots** — Bronze has no maximum on The Table, but it cannot expand into the 1 Gold + 1 Silver reserved slots. If Bronze overflow can consume transformation capacity, the structural protection is gone.
- **Displaying Bronze and Gold projects in a unified priority ranking** — Any UI that renders a single sorted list mixing streams re-introduces the urgency-vs-importance competition the three-stream model structurally prevents. Bronze items with high urgency scores will visually dominate Gold items with high importance scores, undermining the reserved slots.

### Tensions
- With all-Bronze crisis periods — resolution: system supports them without guilt, tracks duration, signals when crisis has passed
- With [[Principle - Empty Slots Strategic]] — empty slots are one form of protection

### Test
Does this design let Bronze overflow into Gold or Silver capacity?
