# Principle - Action Before Explanation

## WHAT: The Principle

Comprehension follows action, never the other way around. Builders learn by doing, then understand what they did. The best tutorials are invisible -- the moment a builder thinks "I'm being taught right now," something has gone wrong. Only teach what the builder needs in the moment they need it.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Advances: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] -- teammates show, they don't lecture
- Advances: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] -- the map teaches by being visible, not by being explained
- Companion: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] -- that principle says "never block progress with knowledge acquisition"; this principle says "never explain before acting"
- Related: [[Principle - Compression and Release]] -- compression obscures what's coming; action-before-explanation ensures the reveal teaches through experience, not narration
- Related: [[Principle - The WOW Chain]] -- each wow is also a lesson disguised as a surprise
- Governs: [[Component - Campfire]] -- one question, no explanation
- Governs: [[Journey - Builder Onboarding]] -- the builder acts before they understand
- Governs: [[Standard - Onboarding Sequence]] -- action precedes explanation at every step
- Governs: [[System - Onboarding]] -- state transitions triggered by builder actions, not by information delivery
- Governs: [[Agent - Jarvis]] -- asks, doesn't explain during onboarding
- Governs: [[Agent - Marvin]] -- arrives with work done, not questions

## WHY: Belief

- Strategy: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]] -- the map reveal IS the explanation; showing beats telling
- Strategy: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] -- teammates demonstrate value through action, not introduction speeches
- Driver: The conversation-first campfire failed because it explained the world before the builder could see it. The builder spent the conversation going "what's a hex? what do you mean stewards?" -- they never got past "what IS this?" to "what can I do here?" The fix: let them do something first, and understanding arrives as a consequence of the action, not as a prerequisite for it.

## WHEN: Timeline

New to the library (2026-02-26). Source: Power of the Portal podcast script. Not yet tested in implementation.

## HOW: Application

### What Following This Looks Like

- The builder's first action happens within 15 seconds of opening the app. They type an answer to ONE question. The world reveals itself through the builder's interaction with it. Understanding arrives after action, not before.
- The builder places a hex on the map before anyone explains what hexes are for. The spatial metaphor clicks BECAUSE they interacted with it, not because someone described it.
- Marvin appears already working on the builder's problem. The builder watches a teammate act before they hear an explanation of what teammates do.

### What Violating This Looks Like

- Seven-screen tutorial explaining features before showing the home screen.
- Describing the hex map through conversation before the builder has seen it.
- Asking "how do you feel about spatial planning?" before showing the map.
- Any moment where the builder thinks "why are you explaining this instead of letting me try it?"
- Marvin introducing himself and explaining his capabilities before doing any work.

### Tensions

- With [[Principle - Agreement Over Expectation]] -- designed alliance requires some explanation before action. Resolution: the "Me" zone shrinks to near-zero in first contact; the world demonstrates what LifeBuild is. The Me/You/Us framework applies to ongoing relationships (Charter, weekly check-ins) where both parties have shared context.
- With thoroughness -- some concepts genuinely need explanation. Resolution: explain AFTER the builder has acted, when they have a mental anchor for the explanation.

### Test

Would the builder learn the same thing faster by doing it than by hearing about it? If yes, let them do it.
