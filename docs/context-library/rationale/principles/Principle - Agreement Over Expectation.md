# Principle - Agreement Over Expectation

## WHAT: The Principle

High-functioning relationships are governed by explicit agreement, not implicit expectation. Before working together, both parties establish what they bring, what they need, and how they'll collaborate — a designed alliance rather than an assumed contract.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Serves: [[Need - Relatedness]] — mutual understanding builds genuine connection
- Serves: [[Need - Autonomy]] — the builder chooses what to share and what to commit to
- Advances: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] — teammates negotiate working agreements, they don't impose defaults
- Companion: [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — that principle governs HOW we acquire knowledge (timing, tone, method); this principle governs WHAT relational knowledge matters and WHY explicit agreement beats implicit expectation
- Governs:
  - [[Component - Campfire]] — where the designed alliance is first established
  - [[Journey - Builder Onboarding]] — the onboarding arc moves through Me/You/Us zones to reach agreement
  - [[Agent - Jarvis]] — Jarvis facilitates the alliance conversation, not a one-sided intake

## WHY: Belief

Implicit expectations breed resentment; explicit agreements build trust. When a builder arrives at LifeBuild, both sides have something to share: LifeBuild explains what it is, what it believes, and how it works (Me); the builder shares why they're here and what they hope changes (You); together they define what the relationship looks like — what each side gives, what each side gets, and what the first steps are (Us).

The relational weight of LifeBuild sits between transactional software (tax prep) and deeply personal service (therapist) — closest to a personal trainer or executive coach. This calibrates the depth of exchange: enough to build a genuine working relationship, not so much that it crosses into inappropriate intimacy. The Co-Active coaching tradition calls this a "Designed Alliance" — a purposeful, stated, adaptable contract co-created between coach and client.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** Post-MVP
**Implementation status:** Not started
**Reality note (2026-02-18):** Surfaced during D5 shaping session (Feb 2026), new to the library. No implementation exists. The campfire conversation (where this principle would first apply) is not yet built. The three-zone framework (Me/You/Us) and its research grounding (Motivational Interviewing, Bordin Working Alliance, Co-Active Designed Alliance, Stages of Change) are documented here but have not been tested in prompt prototypes.

**Implications:** Until the campfire conversation is built and the designed alliance pattern is tested, all onboarding interactions risk falling into implicit expectation mode — the system assumes what the builder wants, or the builder assumes what the system provides. The first prompt prototypes for Jarvis's campfire conversation should explicitly implement the Me/You/Us arc.

## HOW: Application

### The Three Zones

The principle operates through three zones of relational knowledge exchange:

**Me (LifeBuild shares proactively):**

- Jarvis's role — "I'm a counselor here" — the most natural opener
- What LifeBuild is — sets expectations for what follows
- Our philosophies — builds trust through worldview alignment
- How it works — reduces anxiety about what comes next
- Policies, security, technology — available on request but not pushed upfront

**You (What we learn about the builder):**

- Why they're here — seeds the first project
- What they hope might change — gives shape to "done"
- How they're feeling right now — calibrates tone (inferred, not asked)
- The "heavy thing" — emerges naturally from "why are you here," becomes the first project

**Us (The relationship agreement):**

- What you'll actually do here — personalized to the builder's starting state
- What the first few days look like — sets timeline expectations
- What you give / what you get — the core exchange
- Who's here for you — agent roles, personalized to the builder's need

Most "Me" content is reactive (shared when relevant, not dumped upfront). The "You" zone reduces to two core questions (why are you here, what do you hope changes). The "Us" zone cannot be delivered well without first understanding "You."

### The "Useful / Appropriate" Lens

Each piece of relational knowledge has two dimensions: is it useful (does it help the relationship function) and is it appropriate (does it respect the relational weight). Something can be useful but inappropriate (financial details at the campfire), or appropriate but not yet useful (capacity economy before the first project). The campfire conversation should only surface knowledge that is both useful AND appropriate for the current moment.

### What Following This Looks Like

- Jarvis opens the campfire by sharing who he is and what the sanctuary believes — the builder learns about LifeBuild before being asked to share anything about themselves.
- After the builder shares what brought them here, Jarvis reflects it back and proposes what the first few days could look like — the "Us" agreement is co-created, not prescribed.
- When the builder walks to the sanctuary, both sides have a shared understanding: the builder knows what LifeBuild offers, LifeBuild knows what the builder needs, and both have agreed on what happens next.

### What Violating This Looks Like

- **Asking before sharing** — demanding the builder's life story before explaining what LifeBuild is. The "Me" zone comes before the "You" zone because trust must be offered before it's requested.
- **Assuming the agreement** — auto-enrolling the builder in a plan without asking if it matches what they want. "Here's your 72-hour plan" without checking if the builder agrees to it.
- **Treating the agreement as permanent** — the designed alliance is adaptable. If the builder's situation changes, the agreement should be renegotiated, not enforced.

### Tensions

- With speed of onboarding — thorough agreement takes time; resolution is that the three zones can be traversed in a single conversation when pacing matches the builder's stage of change
- With [[Principle - Earn Don't Interrogate]] — that principle says "never block progress with knowledge acquisition," but this principle says "establish agreement before working together"; resolution is that the campfire IS the first moment of value (the builder feels heard), so the agreement conversation is progress, not a gate

### Test

Would both parties say they chose this, or did one party assume?
