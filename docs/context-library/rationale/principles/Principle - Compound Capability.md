# Principle - Compound Capability

## WHAT: The Principle

When facing tradeoffs, optimize for month-12 capability, not week-1 convenience — each week should be easier than the last.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Type: Design Principle
- Serves: [[Need - Competence]] — each week easier than last
- Advances: [[Strategy - Spatial Visibility]], [[Strategy - Superior Process]], [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]]
- Governs: [[Primitive - System]], [[Artifact - The Charter]], [[Standard - Service Levels]], [[Standard - Knowledge Framework]]
- Systems infrastructure: [[System - Priority Queue Architecture]], [[System - Pipeline Architecture]], [[System - Four-Stage Creation]]
- Related: [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] — tension resolved through sequencing

## WHY: Belief

Directors succeed with LifeBuild not by completing a list, but by building compound capability — creating infrastructure, knowledge, and support systems that make future weeks progressively easier.

Four things compound:

1. **Infrastructure** — Systems reduce future Bronze load. Each planted system is future work that runs itself.
2. **Knowledge** — The Charter becomes more accurate, agents become more personalized. Understanding compounds.
3. **Skill** — The director gets better at planning, estimating, and prioritizing. Calibration improves.
4. **Support** — The AI team becomes more capable as it learns patterns. The relationship deepens.

The tradeoff framework: when evaluating two designs, ask "Which one makes Month 12 better?" If Design A is easier to learn but plateaus, and Design B has a steeper curve but compounds, choose Design B — then figure out how to ease the learning curve without sacrificing the compound return.

The disposability test: if a director could switch to a competitor after 6 months without losing significant value, the compound capability isn't working. Lock-in should come from accumulated intelligence and infrastructure that the director values, not from switching costs or data hostage-taking.

## WHEN: Timeline

**Build phase:** MVP (ongoing)
**Implementation status:** Partial
**Reality note (2026-02-10):** Event-sourced architecture (LiveStore) provides foundation for compound data. Priority Queue and Pipeline persist project history. But no Charter, no Knowledge Framework, no Service Levels, no calibration tracking. The compounding mechanisms described (infrastructure, knowledge, skill, support) are mostly aspirational — the data layer exists but the intelligence layer doesn't.

## HOW: Application

Design features that become more valuable over time. Prefer deep-and-rich over simple-and-shallow when the richness compounds. When compound learning is possible, teach rather than automate.

### What Following This Looks Like

- A director plants a "weekly meal prep" system in Month 2. By Month 6, it runs autonomously with Bronze-level maintenance, freeing capacity that now goes to Gold transformation work — the early investment compounds into sustained capacity.
- The Charter captures a director's energy patterns over 8 weeks. By Month 3, Cameron's priority suggestions account for Tuesday fatigue and Thursday peaks — the accumulated knowledge makes every future recommendation more accurate.
- A director who struggled with estimation in Month 1 now consistently plans within 10% accuracy by Month 4, because the system tracked calibration and surfaced the learning — the skill itself compounded.

### What Violating This Looks Like

- **Optimizing for week-1 convenience over month-12 capability** — Design A is easier to learn but plateaus; Design B has a steeper curve but compounds. Choosing A because it demos well sacrifices the compound return that creates lasting value.
- **Building disposable features** — The disposability test: if a director switches to a competitor after 6 months without losing significant value, compound capability isn't working. Features should accumulate intelligence and infrastructure the director values.
- **Automating what should be taught** — When compound learning is possible, teaching builds director skill that compounds. Automating it away creates dependency without growth. The director who learns to plan well gains a skill; the one whose plans are auto-generated gains nothing.

### Tensions

- With [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] — resolved through sequencing: quick wins that also establish compound foundations
- With simplicity — compound features can be complex; resolution is progressive depth with gentle entry

### Test

Does this design make the product feel disposable, or increasingly indispensable?
