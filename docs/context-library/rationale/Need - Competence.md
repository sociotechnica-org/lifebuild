# Need - Competence

## WHAT: Definition

The psychological need to feel capable and effective — to experience mastery, to see that one's actions produce desired outcomes, to grow in skill over time.

## WHERE: Ecosystem

- Foundation: [[Self-Determination Theory]] — one of three innate psychological needs
- Sibling needs: [[Need - Autonomy]], [[Need - Relatedness]]
- Primary bet advancing this: [[Strategy - Superior Process]]
- Supporting bet: [[Strategy - AI as Teammates]] (agents enable accomplishment)

## WHY: Significance

When competence is satisfied, people persist through challenges, seek optimal difficulty, and experience flow. When thwarted — through repeated failure, unclear feedback, or tasks mismatched to skill — people experience helplessness, anxiety, and withdrawal.

In LifeBuild, competence manifests as directors completing what they commit to and improving over time. The three-stream structure protects transformation work. The weekly rhythm creates accomplishment cycles. Calibration tracking shows estimation accuracy improving. Systems compound, making future weeks easier.

The opposite of competence support is learned helplessness: unclear goals, no feedback, tasks too hard or too easy, no visible progress, repeated failure without learning. LifeBuild's design principles protect against these patterns.

## HOW: Application

When evaluating any feature or agent behavior, ask: "Does this help the director feel more capable, or less?"

**Signs of competence support:**

- Clear objectives with visible progress
- Difficulty matched to capacity
- Feedback loops that enable learning
- Improvement tracked over time
- Accomplishment recognized

**Signs of competence threat:**

- Unclear what success looks like
- Overwhelm from too much work
- No feedback on whether approach is working
- Same mistakes repeated without learning
- Accomplishment invisible or dismissed

## Implementing Principles

- [[Principle - Protect Transformation]] — structural protection enables completion
- [[Principle - Compound Capability]] — each week easier than last
- [[Principle - First 72 Hours]] — early wins build confidence
- [[Principle - Plans Are Hypotheses]] — calibration over completion
